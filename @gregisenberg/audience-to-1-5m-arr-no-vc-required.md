1. Pick your niche. "AI workflows for solopreneurs" not "business tips". "riches are in the niches". own your lane.
2. Hit 250,000 impressions/month. one viral hit can do it. but consistency wins. post daily. engage. be THE person in your space.
3. Convert 0.5% to leads = 1250 organic leads/month irresistible lead magnet. so good they'd be dumb not to grab it. calculator, ebook, whatever. just make it valuable. Use claude code to make to build these and create systems so you're experimenting with 3+ tools/lead magnets per month (and double down on the ones that wokr).
4. Monetize leads immediately. each lead nets you $1 from affiliate sales or ads 1250 leads = $1250 to reinvest
5. Buy more leads. spend that $1250 on leads at $2 each 1250 / 2 = 625 additional leads. TikTok ads, X ads, Meta... pick one channel and get good at it. Use AI to help with creative.
6. Total monthly leads: 1875 1250 organic + 625 purchased you're now a lead generation machine
7. Nurture like crazy. weekly newsletter or free community content. give so much value they feel guilty not paying you.
8. Ask the community what you can build for them. Prioritize painpoints
9. Launch $30/month offer. aim for $300+ per customer annually. make it feel like a no-brainer. their "tip" to you for all the free value. Note: you can find startup ideas to get creative juices flowing on

10. Convert 3% of total leads = 56 new customers/month 1875 \* 0.03 = 56 trust = cash. if you've done 1-7 right, this is easy.
11. Year 1: 672 customers = $201,600 ARR 56 \* 12 = 672 672 \* $300 = $201,600 feels small? it's just the beginning.
12. Reinvest profits in lead buying. you're now profitable on each lead. buy more. turn your funnel into a vending machine.
13. Year 3: 5000 customers = $1.5M ARR compound growth is a beautiful thing.
14. Premium power upsell 20% to $100/month. another 5% to $500/month. New ARR: $2.7M (4000 x $300) + (1000 x $1200) + (250 x $6000) = $2.7M
15. 5 year growth plan 50% annual growth. Year 5 ARR: $9.11M
16. Exit for 3-5x ARR = $27M - $45M or keep it and enjoy your cash cow.
17. Cool tropical island you just bought my friend
18. tell your grandchildren how you turned a tweet into generational wealth

im not saying this is easy, it really isn't but this is the framework fo how to get there with no VC required. hope it gets your creative juices flowing.

btw.

yes, you can buy a laundromat or boring business but then you are on the hook for debt

yes, you can buy real estate but then you are on the hook for debt/have to have a large down payment
