A friend just texted me his "life vision" with me. He outlined in detail how he wanted his life to play out over the next few years and it got me thinking…

So many of us don't really have a compass.

We kinda just wake up everyday and do the best we can. Time goes on, we get older and hopefully we make it.

Our dreams just kinda get weaker and weaker over time. Bright stars becoming dimmer and dimmer. We forget what we want. Life gets in the way.

Your life vision can be anything from "I'd like to have a good haircut" to "I want to provide an incredible life for my kids."

And everything in between...

**The key: write it down in great detail. Technicolor detail.**

Here are some examples for you to drive the point home.

**What would be cool to do with your friends and family?**

Maybe you fly your best friends to an island for no reason but to laugh in the warm Caribbean sun. You stay in a 5 star hotel and you catch a glimpse of George Clooney there.

You get to tell them: "Leave your wallets at home."

**Who do you want to spend time with?**

Maybe you want to lose some of the friends that are keeping you back and drink espresso with your favorite podcaster.

"I used to listen to you and now you listen to me!"

**What do you want to look like?**

Maybe you want to lose weight and fit into a size 32 501 Levi jeans like you did when you were 16.

"I look dope."

**What type of person do you want to be?**

Maybe you'd like to be able to always get on a plane to talk in person when someone would benefit from that but doesn't expect it.

"Thank you. I mean it," your friend will say.

**Where is your business in 12 months?**

Maybe you log into Slack, and it's quiet as a still lake. No fires to put out, just notifications of "payment succeeded" in a Slack channel called "cha-ching."

"Cha-ching!"

You get the idea...

Let this vision be your North Star. Align your actions, decisions, and life around it.

It doesn't have to be set in stone, but let it guide you.

Life isn't a linear blueprint but an exciting adventure, a quest of sorts.

The richness of life doesn't come from material wealth alone but from the wealth of experiences, relationships, and purpose.

When you have a clear vision, you're not just drifting — you're steering the ship.

Because there's a world of difference between being adrift and charting your own course.

A clear vision is the lens through which a brighter, clearer future comes into focus. When your inner world shifts, the outer world often dances in tandem.

Remember, even the grandest journeys start with a single step, or as Paul Klee put it, "A line is a dot that went for a walk."

So, what's your line? Where will your dot go?

**Start writing it down.**
