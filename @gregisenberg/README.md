# @gregisenberg

**ceo of late checkout — holding company building community-based businesses. host of the startup ideas podcast. author of greg's letter (100k+ subscribers).**

19 articles across three phases: the substack era (2020–2023), the blog era (2024–2025), and the X articles era (jan 2026). read chronologically, the content gets shallower as the audience gets bigger. the early substack pieces are genuine thinking; the X articles are optimized for engagement. but even in the late work, there are 2–3 ideas per piece that survive scrutiny — and one thesis (community before product) that he's been right about for six years.

## the good

**the unbundling thesis is the strongest standalone article in his entire output.** [the 2020 reddit piece](the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit.md) is clean logic: reddit is to 2020 what craigslist was to 2010 — a horizontal platform ripe for [vertical unbundling](the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit.md#what-is-a-vertical-network). the [discord origin story](the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit.md#case-study-discord) (League of Legends subreddit → discord as "slack for gaming" → $4B valuation) is the canonical case study. he wrote this before most people saw the opportunity. the thesis has aged well — and the method (find the horizontal platform, map the subreddits, identify the vertical community that wants its own home) remains a viable idea-generation technique 6 years later. this is the piece that got him 100k subscribers, and it deserves them.

**the symbiotic growth framing solves a real strategic problem.** product-first vs audience-first is a tired debate. his [symbiotic growth concept](what-kind-of-startup-are-you-building.md#symbiotic-growth) is better: product *and* distribution are conjoined twins, not sequential phases. the examples — [CapCut embedding its signature in every user video](what-kind-of-startup-are-you-building.md#the-patterns), Notion templates pulling in new users, Figma files as viral loops — show products where *using* the product is *marketing* the product. the practical design question this creates ("does this feature make users into advertisers?") is one of the most underused filters in product development. compare with [@venturetwins](../@venturetwins/the-great-expansion.md#strategy-2-the-consumer-to-enterprise-bridge)'s consumer-to-enterprise bridge — both are describing how usage compounds into distribution, but greg frames it as product design while justine frames it as monetization.

**the 95/5 hiring rule is his most contrarian and most practical framework.** [why-i-no-longer-hire-from-harvard](why-i-no-longer-hire-from-harvard.md) — 5% proven expensive hires, 95% non-obvious talent. the [six hiring questions](why-i-no-longer-hire-from-harvard.md#6-questions-to-dig-up-non-obvious-traits) (ran an affiliate program? sold on ebay? ran a meme page? led a gaming clan?) are designed to find people who've *done things on the internet* — which is the actual job description for most early-stage startups. whether you agree with each specific signal or not, the framework forces a genuine rethink of what "talent" means for internet businesses. most hiring advice is useless. this isn't.

**the "what goes up" piece is his tightest thesis statement.** [what-goes-up-in-an-ai-slop-world](what-goes-up-in-an-ai-slop-world.md) does in two lists what the newsletter tries to do in 3000 words: trust and brand appreciate when software is cheap; generic wrappers and thin moats depreciate. the [observations section](what-goes-up-in-an-ai-slop-world.md#in-a-world-where-ai-slop-is-everywhere-and-its-easier-than-ever-to-build-software) underneath is the best short-form thinking he's done. "speed to clarity beats speed to market." "people stop competing on originality and start competing on alignment." "who understands my situation? who speaks my language?" — this is the version of greg that 100k people actually want to read. notably, this is also where his worldview intersects with [@venturetwins](../@venturetwins/most-people-cant-vibe-code.md)'s vibe coding thesis: when building software costs nothing, the scarce resource is taste, trust, and knowing *what* to build.

**the $10M mobile app playbook is the most actionable X article.** [10m-playbook-rebuilding-mobile-apps](10m-playbook-rebuilding-mobile-apps.md) has a specific research workflow: Sensor Tower → filter for sub-4 star apps with strong retention → focus on [revenue per download](10m-playbook-rebuilding-mobile-apps.md#heres-the-exact-playbook-someone-will-use-to-make-10m-in-2026-rebuilding-existing-mobile-apps) not total revenue. this is the kind of detail that separates advice from operator knowledge. the app holdco model (buy small profitable apps, add AI, improve UX, use cashflow to buy more) is his clearest articulation of the Late Checkout thesis applied to 2026. the "sub-4 star but strong retention" signal is genuinely non-obvious.

**the idea machine process is actually usable.** [two running lists](how-to-become-an-idea-machine.md#two-lists-with-all-of-my-ideas) (notion + notes), 30-minute [gardening sessions](how-to-become-an-idea-machine.md#gardening-for-the-best-ideas) twice a week, ["why now?"](how-to-become-an-idea-machine.md#why-now) as the key filter, [one-liner tweets as minimum viable posts](how-to-become-an-idea-machine.md#scroll-stoppers-only) before writing long-form. this scales from zero. it's implementable on monday. the "why now?" filter alone is worth the read — it's the question that kills 90% of zombie ideas.

**he's honest about his own failures in the loom piece.** [how-i-almost-made-4m-on-loom](how-i-almost-made-4m-on-loom.md) — openly processing a missed $3-4M investment, quoting his own "no thanks" email back to himself. this lands differently than the usual humble-brag. it's the only piece where he's genuinely vulnerable rather than strategically vulnerable.

## the bad

**every piece is a funnel, and reading them in bulk makes the funneling unmissable.** the full articles reveal 3-5 product plugs per newsletter — community empire enrollment, dispatch for designs, boring marketing for SEO, skool subscription. [the faceless brands piece](the-guide-to-faceless-brands.md) plugs dispatch in the opening paragraph. [why-i-no-longer-hire-from-harvard](why-i-no-longer-hire-from-harvard.md) opens with two pre-article plugs before a single word of editorial. the X articles swap newsletter plugs for ideabrowser.com plugs — [40-reasons-2026](40-reasons-2026-is-the-best-time-to-build.md) plugs it 5 times in 40 items. across 19 articles, there are 50+ discrete product placements. individually, each reads as part of the format. in bulk, it *is* the format. the elephant in the room: greg's content business and greg's advice business are the same business. he teaches community-first monetization *by doing it to you*.

**"community" is doing too much work.** the word appears in virtually every article and means different things depending on what he's selling. sometimes it means discord servers, sometimes skool courses, sometimes just an email list, sometimes "your audience." the conflation lets him claim community-first credentials for products that are, in practice, newsletters with a paid tier. the theory (community before product) is sound. the execution (calling everything a community) stretches the term until it breaks.

**the [audience-to-1.5M-ARR framework](audience-to-1-5m-arr-no-vc-required.md) is encouragement dressed as math.** the assumptions are load-bearing and unstated: 250,000 impressions/month requires significant existing distribution. the 3% lead conversion rate requires excellent nurturing. the year-5 projection of $9M ARR requires 50% annual growth for five consecutive years. none of this is impossible but presenting it as a framework obscures how much depends on the product and founder being exceptional. the funnel logic is sound; the numbers are aspirational.

**his idea quality is extremely variable.** [11-juicy-startup-ideas](11-juicy-startup-ideas.md) is representative: "farmcart" (instacart for farmers markets) and "saint decaf" (leading decaf coffee brand) are legitimate opportunities. "ghost town revival" (renovating ghost towns) is a private equity real estate thesis dressed as a startup idea. "hagglebot" is a feature, not a company. he generates at volume and doesn't filter at the quality his best ideas deserve.

**he never writes about failure at depth.** the [loom piece](how-i-almost-made-4m-on-loom.md) is the most failure-facing, and even that reframes into [positive lessons](how-i-almost-made-4m-on-loom.md#1-the-power-in-starting-small-and-imperfect). the real texture of running multiple businesses — which ones failed, what killed them, what he'd undo — is almost entirely absent. [40-reasons-2026](40-reasons-2026-is-the-best-time-to-build.md) is pure upside framing with no acknowledgment that most of those 40 opportunities will be crowded to zero by the time the article circulates.

**the content gets shallower as the audience gets bigger.** the early substack pieces ([unbundling reddit](the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit.md), [symbiotic growth](what-kind-of-startup-are-you-building.md)) are his most substantive. the 2024-2025 blog pieces ([buttons](buttons.md), [this-is-on-my-mind](this-is-on-my-mind.md)) are significantly thinner. the X articles are even shorter — listicles without connective tissue. the quality follows an inverse power curve: as reach goes up, depth goes down. he's optimizing for the right metric for his business (audience size) and the wrong metric for his legacy (intellectual contribution).

## patterns in their thinking

**the thesis: community before product.** this is the load-bearing idea across everything he writes. build audience → validate ideas with audience → sell products to audience. he practices it. his businesses are built this way. it's his most principled and consistent position. best articulated in [rethinking sales funnels](how-im-rethinking-sales-funnels.md) (community-in-the-middle) and [symbiotic growth](what-kind-of-startup-are-you-building.md#symbiotic-growth).

**he mistrusts vc orthodoxy.** the anti-VC thread runs through multiple pieces: VCs chanting "focus" serves their portfolio, not founders ([spicy takes](im-feeling-spicy-today.md)); 95% of startups don't need pre-seed; giving up 20% for $500K is a bad trade. [audience-to-1.5M-ARR](audience-to-1-5m-arr-no-vc-required.md) opens with "build audience, build community, sell product" as the no-VC alternative. this is his most genuine conviction and the position where he has the most credibility.

**the X articles reveal a coherent 2026 worldview.** three interlocking theses: (1) trust and brand are the scarcest resource in an AI-commoditized world ([what-goes-up](what-goes-up-in-an-ai-slop-world.md)); (2) mobile apps and micro-SaaS are having a second act because build cost dropped 99% ([10m-playbook](10m-playbook-rebuilding-mobile-apps.md)); (3) audience-first businesses compound better because distribution is owned, not rented ([audience-to-1.5M-ARR](audience-to-1-5m-arr-no-vc-required.md)). this is coherent even when the individual articles are uneven. and it's the opposite of the technical authors' worldview — while [@ashpreetbedi](../@ashpreetbedi/README.md) and [@hwchase17](../@hwchase17/README.md) think the bottleneck is infrastructure, greg thinks the bottleneck is distribution.

**he's building in public more than he's thinking in public.** the best creator writing makes you see something you couldn't see before. a lot of greg's content makes you aware of greg's businesses. the unbundling thesis and symbiotic growth made people see differently. the multipreneur manifesto and the life vision piece make people aware of Late Checkout. the ratio has shifted toward the latter.

## worth stealing

1. **[unbundling as a search pattern](the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit.md#the-great-unbundling-of-reddit)** — find the horizontal platform, map the subreddits, identify the vertical community. durable idea-generation method, works beyond reddit.
2. **[symbiotic growth](what-kind-of-startup-are-you-building.md#symbiotic-growth) as a product filter** — "does this feature make users into advertisers?" if yes, build it first.
3. **[the 95/5 hiring rule](why-i-no-longer-hire-from-harvard.md)** — 5% expensive proven talent, 95% non-obvious internet hustlers. the six questions are the actionable part.
4. **["why now?" as the key filter](how-to-become-an-idea-machine.md#why-now)** — kills 90% of zombie ideas. if you can't answer why this works *now* and didn't work 2 years ago, move on.
5. **[revenue per download](10m-playbook-rebuilding-mobile-apps.md#heres-the-exact-playbook-someone-will-use-to-make-10m-in-2026-rebuilding-existing-mobile-apps)** — filters for sticky, underserved apps better than total revenue or ratings.
6. **[trust compression](what-goes-up-in-an-ai-slop-world.md#in-a-world-where-ai-slop-is-everywhere-and-its-easier-than-ever-to-build-software)** — when software is cheap, the human brain flips from "is this possible?" to "who is behind this?" brand and community win because they reduce decision fatigue.
7. **["cringe mountain"](advice-for-your-20s.md#for-all-those-in-their-20s)** — item 45: "you sweat, you shake, you look stupid. and then one day, it breaks open. and suddenly you're the only one with a view." steal this framing.
8. **[one-liner as minimum viable post](how-to-become-an-idea-machine.md#scroll-stoppers-only)** — test the idea as a single tweet. if it doesn't land in one sentence, the essay won't save it.

## what's missing

- **unit economics of the multipreneur model.** he talks about running 5+ businesses in [the manifesto](the-multipreneur-manifesto.md) but never discusses context switching costs, management overhead, quality dilution, or which businesses actually failed.
- **community failure modes.** toxic communities, moderation hellscapes, parasocial dependencies, communities that grow but don't convert. all common. none discussed.
- **the selection bias problem.** his case studies are things that worked. what's the base rate? how many "community-first" businesses fail at step 3?
- **competition analysis for his own playbooks.** when hundreds of readers simultaneously follow the [40 reasons](40-reasons-2026-is-the-best-time-to-build.md) playbook, the opportunities are crowded before they're tried. this is never acknowledged.
- **the [audience-to-ARR math](audience-to-1-5m-arr-no-vc-required.md) stress-tested.** what's the failure rate at each assumption? what typically kills this at step 3 vs step 9?
- **the obvious tension: he teaches community-first monetization by monetizing his own community.** this isn't hypocrisy — it's alignment. but it's never examined. the content, the plugs, the courses, the communities — they're all the same thing. greg *is* the case study for his own thesis, and the case study has selection bias because it only includes the version that worked.
