# @gregisenberg

**ceo of late checkout — holding company building community-based businesses. host of the startup ideas podcast. author of greg's letter (100k+ subscribers).**

previously sold two companies. early at reddit. now runs a portfolio of community-first products: design agency, seo agency, discord communities, skool communities, podcast, newsletter.

13 articles across two phases: the substack era (2020–2023, latecheckout.substack.com) and the blog era (2024–2025, gregisenberg.com/blog). the writing reflects the man: high energy, repeating the same 4-5 ideas in different clothing, genuinely useful practical frameworks mixed with vibes-heavy filler.

## the good

**the unbundling thesis is his sharpest idea.** the 2020 reddit piece is the strongest standalone article he's written. the logic is clean: reddit is to 2020 what craigslist was to 2010 — a horizontal platform ripe for vertical unbundling. the discord origin story as case study is well-chosen. he saw this early and framed it clearly. this kind of thing is why 100k people read his newsletter.

**the symbiotic growth framing is genuinely useful.** product-first vs audience-first is a tired dichotomy. his "product *and* distribution are conjoined twins" reframe is better than most takes on this. the examples — capcut embedding its signature in every user video, notion templates pulling in new users, figma files as viral loops — are concrete and illustrative. this is the kind of thinking that helps founders before they build, not after.

**the hiring framework is practical and underrated.** the 95/5 rule (5% proven hires, 95% non-obvious talent) and his six non-obvious hiring questions (affiliate marketer? ebay seller? meme page? gaming clan?) cut through the credential obsession that plagues early-stage startups. whether you agree with each item or not, it's a usable framework that forces you to think differently about what "talent" actually looks like for internet businesses. most hiring advice is useless. this one is actionable.

**the idea machine process is good infrastructure content.** two running lists (notion + notes), 30-minute gardening sessions twice a week, "why now?" as the key filter, external validation via one-liner tweets before writing long-form — this is a real system. it scales well from zero. it's the kind of thing you can actually implement on monday.

**he's honest about his own failures.** the loom piece — openly processing a missed $3-4M investment, quoting his own "no thanks" email back to himself — lands differently than the usual humble-brag. his self-criticism in the spicy takes piece ("i know this might sound hypocritical") is also more self-aware than most. he doesn't just preach; he includes himself in the indictment.

**the spicy takes piece is his most enjoyable writing.** newsletter subscriber ghost rates, solopreneur burnout, the vc "focus" narrative as self-interest, mrr charts as vanity metrics, building-in-public as shark bait — most of these hold up. he's at his best when he's not trying to teach and just saying what he actually thinks.

## the bad

**every piece is a funnel.** this is the unavoidable reality of reading greg in bulk: every newsletter ends with 2-3 plugs for community empire, dispatch, boring marketing, or skool. the product placement is relentless. he's selling in every single issue without exception. on any individual article it reads fine; across 13 pieces it becomes the loudest thing in the room.

**"community" is doing too much work.** the word appears in virtually every article and means different things depending on what he's selling. sometimes it means discord servers, sometimes skool courses, sometimes just an email list, sometimes "your audience." the conflation lets him claim community-first credentials for products that are, in practice, just newsletters with a paid tier. the theory is sound but the term is stretched until it breaks.

**the multipreneur content is thin.** the multipreneur manifesto is the weakest of the substantive pieces — a lot of energy ("this fires me up!") in service of a four-step framework any business school student could have written. "have a thesis," "set constraints," "think about marketing," "hire people." the framing of late checkout as a model multipreneur operation would be more convincing with actual numbers, actual case studies, actual failures.

**the life vision piece is filler.** it's motivational poster content dressed as a newsletter. "write down your dreams in technicolor detail" is not an insight. "a line is a dot that went for a walk" (paul klee quote) closing a business newsletter about life vision is the kind of content that reads as filler even to its biggest fans. the piece self-describes as "the most important post i've written in a while" which makes the thinness even more apparent.

**his idea quality is extremely variable.** the 11 juicy ideas piece is representative: 'farmcart' (instacart for farmers markets) and 'saint decaf' (leading decaf coffee brand) are legitimate opportunities. 'ghost town revival' (renovating and monetizing ghost towns) is a private equity real estate thesis dressed as a startup idea. 'hagglebot' is a feature, not a company. his this is on my mind piece has the same issue — the sandra/cardboard cutout story is genuinely useful; the "paperwork" idea (ai doc generator for restaurants) is also genuinely good. but they're bundled with softer observations without distinction.

**he never writes about failure at depth.** his missed loom investment is the most failure-facing piece, and even that is framed as "here's what i learned, here's how i now do better." the real texture of running multiple businesses — which ones didn't work, what killed them, what he'd undo — is almost entirely absent. "71% of my startups made money in 2023 vs 25% in 2022" (quoted tweet from someone else) is the closest we get to a failure rate.

## patterns in his thinking

**the thesis: community before product.** this is the load-bearing idea across everything he writes. build an audience, validate ideas with the audience, sell products to the audience. it's a sound framework and he applies it consistently. his own businesses are built this way. he practices what he preaches.

**he mistrusts vc orthodoxy.** the anti-vc theme runs through multiple pieces: vcs chanting "focus" serves their portfolio construction, not founders; 95% of startups don't need pre-seed capital; giving up 20% for $500k is a bad trade in 2023. this is his most principled position and the one he returns to most reliably. it's also the one his audience (aspiring bootstrappers and small operators) most wants to hear.

**he's attracted to "non-obvious" as a category.** non-obvious hiring traits, non-obvious startup ideas, non-obvious distribution strategies. this is a genuine intellectual instinct — he looks for things that aren't in the standard playbook. the output is uneven (some non-obvious insights are genuinely valuable; some are just contrarianism dressed up) but the instinct is right.

**the content gets shallower as the audience gets bigger.** the early substack pieces (unbundling reddit, symbiotic growth) are his most substantive. the 2024-2025 blog pieces (buttons, this is on my mind) are significantly thinner — more observation, less argument. this is a common trajectory for creator-writers once they hit scale: more consistent, less interesting.

**he's building in public more than he's thinking in public.** the best creator writing makes you see something you couldn't see before. a lot of greg's content makes you aware of greg's businesses. that's not the same thing.

## worth stealing

1. **unbundling as a search pattern.** find the horizontal platform in your domain (reddit, craigslist, airbnb) and map what vertical community could be carved out of it. durable idea-generation method.
2. **symbiotic growth as a product design criterion.** when evaluating a feature, ask: does this make users into advertisers? does sharing the product extend the product? if not, why not?
3. **the gardening metaphor for ideas.** two 30-minute sessions per week. prioritize + synthesize. "why now?" as the key filter. immediately usable.
4. **the 95/5 hiring rule.** reserve a small fraction for expensive proven talent; fill the rest with people who've hustled on the internet.
5. **one-liner as minimum viable post.** before writing long-form, test the idea as a single sentence on twitter. if it doesn't land there, the essay won't save it.

## what's missing

- **unit economics of the multipreneur model.** he talks about running 5+ businesses but never discusses the real cost — context switching, management overhead, divided founder attention, quality dilution.
- **community failure modes.** building community is presented as almost universally good. toxic communities, moderation hellscapes, parasocial dependencies, and communities that grow but don't buy are all common. none get airtime.
- **the selection bias problem.** his content is mostly case studies of things that worked. what's the base rate? how many "community-first" businesses fail?
- **depth on ai.** his recent writing gestures at ai and vibe marketing but doesn't go deep. his 2025 tweets about optimal startup teams in cursor are more interesting than anything in the newsletter.
