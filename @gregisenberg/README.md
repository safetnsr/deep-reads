# @gregisenberg

**ceo of late checkout — holding company building community-based businesses. host of the startup ideas podcast. author of greg's letter (100k+ subscribers).**

previously sold two companies. early at reddit. now runs a portfolio of community-first products: design agency, seo agency, discord communities, skool communities, podcast, newsletter.

19 articles across three phases: the substack era (2020–2023, latecheckout.substack.com), the blog era (2024–2025, gregisenberg.com/blog), and the X articles era (jan 2026, x.com articles). the X articles are revealing — they drop the newsletter infrastructure (no plugs, no open-rate optimized hooks) and show what he actually thinks in real time. the format is looser, more listicle, and more honest about the funnel behind his worldview.

## the good

**the unbundling thesis is his sharpest idea.** [the 2020 reddit piece](the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit.md) is the strongest standalone article he's written. the logic is clean: reddit is to 2020 what craigslist was to 2010 — a horizontal platform ripe for [vertical unbundling](the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit.md#what-is-a-vertical-network). the [discord origin story](the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit.md#case-study-discord) as case study is well-chosen. he saw this early and framed it clearly. this kind of thing is why 100k people read his newsletter.

**the symbiotic growth framing is genuinely useful.** product-first vs audience-first is a tired dichotomy. his "product *and* distribution are conjoined twins" reframe in [what kind of startup are you building](what-kind-of-startup-are-you-building.md#symbiotic-growth) is better than most takes on this. the examples — capcut embedding its signature in every user video, notion templates pulling in new users, figma files as viral loops — are concrete and illustrative via [the patterns](what-kind-of-startup-are-you-building.md#the-patterns). this is the kind of thinking that helps founders before they build, not after.

**the hiring framework is practical and underrated.** the [95/5 rule](why-i-no-longer-hire-from-harvard.md) (5% proven hires, 95% non-obvious talent) and his [six non-obvious hiring questions](why-i-no-longer-hire-from-harvard.md#6-questions-to-dig-up-non-obvious-traits) (affiliate marketer? ebay seller? meme page? gaming clan?) cut through the credential obsession that plagues early-stage startups. whether you agree with each item or not, it's a usable framework that forces you to think differently about what "talent" actually looks like for internet businesses. most hiring advice is useless. this one is actionable.

**the idea machine process is good infrastructure content.** [two running lists](how-to-become-an-idea-machine.md#two-lists-with-all-of-my-ideas) (notion + notes), 30-minute [gardening sessions](how-to-become-an-idea-machine.md#gardening-for-the-best-ideas) twice a week, ["why now?"](how-to-become-an-idea-machine.md#why-now) as the key filter, [external validation](how-to-become-an-idea-machine.md#external-validation) via one-liner tweets before writing long-form — this is a real system. it scales well from zero. it's the kind of thing you can actually implement on monday.

**he's honest about his own failures.** [the loom piece](how-i-almost-made-4m-on-loom.md) — openly processing a missed $3-4M investment, quoting his own "no thanks" email back to himself — lands differently than the usual humble-brag. his self-criticism in [the spicy takes piece](im-feeling-spicy-today.md) ("i know this might sound hypocritical") is also more self-aware than most. he doesn't just preach; he includes himself in the indictment.

**the spicy takes piece is his most enjoyable writing.** [i'm feeling spicy today](im-feeling-spicy-today.md) — newsletter subscriber ghost rates, solopreneur burnout, the vc "focus" narrative as self-interest, mrr charts as vanity metrics, building-in-public as shark bait — most of these hold up. he's at his best when he's not trying to teach and just saying what he actually thinks.

**the "what goes up" piece is his most compact thesis statement.** [what goes up in an AI slop world](what-goes-up-in-an-ai-slop-world.md) does in two lists what the newsletter tries to do in 3000 words: trust and brand and community appreciate when software is cheap; generic wrappers and thin moats depreciate. the observation section underneath is the best short-form thinking he's done — particularly ["speed to clarity" beats "speed to market"](what-goes-up-in-an-ai-slop-world.md#in-a-world-where-ai-slop-is-everywhere-and-its-easier-than-ever-to-build-software) and the "alignment over originality" point. punchy and genuinely useful.

**the $10M mobile app playbook is his most actionable new piece.** [10m-playbook-rebuilding-mobile-apps](10m-playbook-rebuilding-mobile-apps.md) is the X article that holds up best under scrutiny. the specific research workflow (sensor tower, filter for sub-4 star apps with strong retention, focus on [revenue per download](10m-playbook-rebuilding-mobile-apps.md#heres-the-exact-playbook-someone-will-use-to-make-10m-in-2026-rebuilding-existing-mobile-apps) not total revenue) is the kind of detail that separates advice from real operator knowledge. the app holdco model — buy small profitable apps, add AI, improve UX, use cashflow to buy more — is his clearest articulation of the late checkout thesis in practical terms.

## the bad

**every piece is a funnel, and the funneling is more aggressive than the truncated versions suggested.** the full articles reveal 3-5 product plugs per newsletter — not 2-3. the pattern: a plug before the article (community empire enrollment, closing soon), the article itself, a plug mid-article (dispatch for designs, boring marketing for seo), and 2-3 plugs in the footer (community empire, dispatch, boring marketing, skool subscription). the [faceless brands](the-guide-to-faceless-brands.md) piece plugs dispatch in the opening paragraph and closes with community empire + skool + boring marketing. [why i no longer hire from harvard](why-i-no-longer-hire-from-harvard.md) opens with two pre-article plugs (yung pueblo podcast, community empire enrollment) before a single word of editorial content. across 12 newsletter issues, that's 40+ discrete product placements. on any individual article it reads as part of the format; in bulk it is the format.

**the X articles trade newsletter plugs for ideabrowser.com plugs.** this isn't an improvement — it's a format swap. [40-reasons-2026-is-the-best-time-to-build](40-reasons-2026-is-the-best-time-to-build.md) plugs ideabrowser 5 times in 40 items. [audience-to-1-5m-arr](audience-to-1-5m-arr-no-vc-required.md) plugs it in the middle of a numbered framework. [10m-playbook-rebuilding-mobile-apps](10m-playbook-rebuilding-mobile-apps.md) drops ideabrowser.com and sensortower in the same breath as if both are equal-value research tools. the URL placement is more aggressive in the X format because there's less editorial content to hide in.

**"community" is doing too much work.** the word appears in virtually every article and means different things depending on what he's selling. sometimes it means discord servers, sometimes skool courses, sometimes just an email list, sometimes "your audience." the conflation lets him claim community-first credentials for products that are, in practice, just newsletters with a paid tier. the theory is sound but the term is stretched until it breaks.

**the multipreneur content is thin.** [the multipreneur manifesto](the-multipreneur-manifesto.md) is the weakest of the substantive pieces — a lot of energy ("this fires me up!") in service of a [four-step framework](the-multipreneur-manifesto.md#heres-four-steps-to-building-a-company-that-creates-companies) any business school student could have written. "have a thesis," "set constraints," "think about marketing," "hire people." the framing of late checkout as a model multipreneur operation would be more convincing with actual numbers, actual case studies, actual failures.

**the life vision piece is filler, and the 20s advice piece is close.** [the most important post](the-most-important-post-life-vision.md) is motivational poster content dressed as a newsletter. [advice-for-your-20s](advice-for-your-20s.md) is more grounded — item 45 (the "cringe mountain" line) is the best single sentence he's written. but most of the 45 items are standard internet wisdom ("lift weights," "move to a big city," "avoid debt") mixed with self-promotional items (item 44: "use claude code to outperform 99% of people"). the format as a listicle lets him include filler without accountability.

**the [audience-to-1-5m-arr framework](audience-to-1-5m-arr-no-vc-required.md) is optimistic accounting.** the math is clean (0.5% lead conversion, 3% subscriber conversion, 50% annual growth) but the assumptions are load-bearing and unstated. 250,000 impressions/month is not easy to achieve without significant existing distribution. the 3% conversion rate on leads requires excellent nurturing and a product people actually want. the year-5 ARR of $9M requires 50% annual growth for five consecutive years. none of this is impossible, but presenting it as a framework obscures how much depends on the quality of the product and founder. this is encouragement dressed as math.

**his idea quality is extremely variable.** [the 11 juicy ideas piece](11-juicy-startup-ideas.md) is representative: 'farmcart' (instacart for farmers markets) and 'saint decaf' (leading decaf coffee brand) are legitimate opportunities. 'ghost town revival' (renovating and monetizing ghost towns) is a private equity real estate thesis dressed as a startup idea. 'hagglebot' is a feature, not a company.

**he never writes about failure at depth.** [the missed loom investment](how-i-almost-made-4m-on-loom.md) is the most failure-facing piece, and even that is framed as "[the power in starting small](how-i-almost-made-4m-on-loom.md#1-the-power-in-starting-small-and-imperfect)" and "[diversification fuels wealth](how-i-almost-made-4m-on-loom.md#2-diversification-fuels-wealth)." the real texture of running multiple businesses — which ones didn't work, what killed them, what he'd undo — is almost entirely absent. same in the X articles: [40-reasons-2026-is-the-best-time-to-build](40-reasons-2026-is-the-best-time-to-build.md) is pure upside framing; no acknowledgment that most of these 40 opportunities will be crowded to zero.

## patterns in his thinking

**the thesis: community before product.** this is the load-bearing idea across everything he writes. build an audience, validate ideas with the audience, sell products to the audience. it's a sound framework and he applies it consistently — best articulated in [rethinking sales funnels](how-im-rethinking-sales-funnels.md) and [symbiotic growth](what-kind-of-startup-are-you-building.md). his own businesses are built this way. he practices what he preaches.

**he mistrusts vc orthodoxy.** the anti-vc theme runs through multiple pieces: vcs chanting "focus" serves their portfolio construction, not founders ([spicy takes](im-feeling-spicy-today.md)); 95% of startups don't need pre-seed capital; giving up 20% for $500k is a bad trade in 2023. this is his most principled position and the one he returns to most reliably. the X articles double down on this: [audience-to-1-5m-arr](audience-to-1-5m-arr-no-vc-required.md) opens with "build audience, build community, sell product" as the no-vc alternative to laundromats and real estate.

**he's attracted to "non-obvious" as a category.** non-obvious [hiring traits](why-i-no-longer-hire-from-harvard.md#6-questions-to-dig-up-non-obvious-traits), non-obvious [startup ideas](11-juicy-startup-ideas.md), non-obvious distribution strategies. this is a genuine intellectual instinct — he looks for things that aren't in the standard playbook. the output is uneven but the instinct is right.

**the content gets shallower as the audience gets bigger.** the early substack pieces ([unbundling reddit](the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit.md), [symbiotic growth](what-kind-of-startup-are-you-building.md)) are his most substantive. the 2024-2025 blog pieces ([buttons](buttons.md), [this is on my mind](this-is-on-my-mind.md)) are significantly thinner. the X articles are even shorter — listicles without the connective tissue of the newsletter essays. the crispness is sometimes an asset ([what-goes-up-in-an-ai-slop-world](what-goes-up-in-an-ai-slop-world.md)) and sometimes just thin ([40-reasons-2026-is-the-best-time-to-build](40-reasons-2026-is-the-best-time-to-build.md)).

**he's building in public more than he's thinking in public.** the best creator writing makes you see something you couldn't see before. a lot of greg's content makes you aware of greg's businesses. the X articles are somewhat more honest — no newsletter CTAs — but ideabrowser.com fills the same structural role.

**the X articles reveal his actual worldview on 2026.** three themes dominate: (1) trust and brand are the scarcest thing in an AI-commoditized world ([what-goes-up](what-goes-up-in-an-ai-slop-world.md)); (2) mobile apps and micro-SaaS are having a second act because the build cost has dropped 99% ([10m-playbook](10m-playbook-rebuilding-mobile-apps.md), [40-reasons](40-reasons-2026-is-the-best-time-to-build.md#reasons-1-40)); (3) audience-first businesses compound better than product-first because the distribution is owned, not rented ([audience-to-1-5m-arr](audience-to-1-5m-arr-no-vc-required.md)). this is a coherent worldview even if the individual articles are uneven.

## worth stealing

1. **[unbundling as a search pattern](the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit.md#the-great-unbundling-of-reddit).** find the horizontal platform in your domain and map what vertical community could be carved out of it. durable idea-generation method.
2. **[symbiotic growth](what-kind-of-startup-are-you-building.md#symbiotic-growth) as a product design criterion.** when evaluating a feature, ask: does this make users into advertisers? does sharing the product extend the product?
3. **[the gardening metaphor for ideas](how-to-become-an-idea-machine.md#gardening-for-the-best-ideas).** two 30-minute sessions per week. prioritize + synthesize. ["why now?"](how-to-become-an-idea-machine.md#why-now) as the key filter.
4. **[the 95/5 hiring rule](why-i-no-longer-hire-from-harvard.md).** reserve a small fraction for expensive proven talent; fill the rest with people who've hustled on the internet.
5. **[one-liner as minimum viable post](how-to-become-an-idea-machine.md#scroll-stoppers-only).** before writing long-form, test the idea as a single sentence on twitter. if it doesn't land there, the essay won't save it.
6. **[revenue per download as a research metric](10m-playbook-rebuilding-mobile-apps.md#heres-the-exact-playbook-someone-will-use-to-make-10m-in-2026-rebuilding-existing-mobile-apps).** filters for sticky, underserved apps better than total revenue or ratings. the "sub-4 star but strong retention" signal is real operator knowledge.
7. **["cringe mountain"](advice-for-your-20s.md#for-all-those-in-their-20s).** item 45 from the 20s piece: "you sweat, you shake, you look stupid. and then one day, it breaks open. and suddenly you're the only one with a view." steal this framing.
8. **[trust compression, not tool improvement](what-goes-up-in-an-ai-slop-world.md#in-a-world-where-ai-slop-is-everywhere-and-its-easier-than-ever-to-build-software).** when software is cheap, the human brain flips its filter from "is this possible?" to "who is behind this?" brand and community win not because they're better products, but because they reduce decision fatigue.

## what's missing

- **unit economics of the multipreneur model.** he talks about running 5+ businesses in [the manifesto](the-multipreneur-manifesto.md) but never discusses the real cost — context switching, management overhead, divided founder attention, quality dilution.
- **community failure modes.** building community is presented as almost universally good across [funnels](how-im-rethinking-sales-funnels.md), [faceless brands](the-guide-to-faceless-brands.md), and [symbiotic growth](what-kind-of-startup-are-you-building.md). toxic communities, moderation hellscapes, parasocial dependencies, and communities that grow but don't buy are all common. none get airtime.
- **the selection bias problem.** his content is mostly case studies of things that worked. what's the base rate? how many "community-first" businesses fail?
- **depth on what actually happens when hundreds of people follow the [40 reasons](40-reasons-2026-is-the-best-time-to-build.md) playbook simultaneously.** the opportunities are real but the analysis assumes you're the only person acting on them.
- **the [audience-to-1-5m-arr math](audience-to-1-5m-arr-no-vc-required.md) stress-tested.** what's the failure rate on each assumption? what kills this at step 3 vs step 9?
