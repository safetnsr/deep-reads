Zero.

That's the median number of likes a tweet gets.

It may not feel that way, scrolling through Twitter's ever-changing algorithm and only seeing the posts who've already received external validation. But most Twitter users (the ones we don't see) are screaming to nobody — and that's not where you want to be.

Today, I want to walk through my process for validating my ideas — for both content and products. How I capture my thoughts, choose the best ones, and turn them into beautifully packaged, public-facing winners.

Sharing this because I think this makes you an idea machine.

## Two lists with all of my ideas

I have a Notion page titled "Ideas" — which is just several running lists of thoughts that come into my brain. It's structured into different categories:

- Tweets
- Substacks
- Names (usually domain name ideas)
- Sayings (ex. "Do you mind if we blow your mind?")
- Logos (ex. Flying saucer with rainbow coming out of it)

Some of the ideas are dumb and silly, which is perfectly fine. Some of the ideas come from things I see — for example, I saw an umbrella at the beach and thought, "That's a logo." And I write it down. Others come from listening to podcasts or watching YouTube.

I also have a page in my Notes app that is ideas for startups. This one's a bit more unstructured. It's never ending.

## Gardening for the best ideas

For 30 minutes twice a week, I have time blocked off in my schedule to review my lists. I call it **gardening** — which consists of two ways of thinking deeper:

1. **Prioritize:** What are the most interesting ideas?
2. **Synthesize:** How can I say this in a more clear & concise way?

## Why now?

That's the most important question I ask myself when sorting through these ideas.

Why should I be tweeting this now?
Why does this need to come out right this second?

I think the reason I always find myself asking this is because ideas that come out at the right time have the highest likelihood of spreading.

For example: right now, what are a lot of people talking about? How AI can make us more productive.

I had been sitting on an "how to use AI to boost productivity" free community idea for 8 months. And I had the name too, YouProbablyNeedaRobot.com. Now was the time, and it grew to 25000+ Discord members in 3 weeks. All from a few tweets.

**Timing isn't everything but it's a lot.**

## Scroll-stoppers only

I always try to prioritize insight bombs when posting. I enjoy thinking outside the box and communicating the ideas that others might not be thinking of.

Every time you see my name, I want it to be attached to a scroll-stopping idea — something that grabs your attention. Something that you need to see.

I want people to see my ideas. I want to create conversations. If I'm choosing between two things I want to post, the one that has a better chance to stop the scroll is the one I'll pick.

## External validation

So everything up to this point has been internal. If an idea is really sticking out to me, here's what I'll do:

**Throw it up on Twitter and LinkedIn as a one liner.**

(Remember: the median tweet gets zero likes, so if you haven't built an audience on Twitter, I think LinkedIn is the best place to start.)

If the idea resonates, I'll turn it into a Twitter thread or a longer LinkedIn post. I'll type it all out in 10-15 minutes, throw it into ChatGPT (my prompt is always "Pretend you're a copy editor"), and once it's cleaned up I'll post that.

If it resonates again, I'll move it to a newsletter or blog post. And if that hits, I know I'm onto something — so it's time to talk about it on my podcast and short-form video.

This is my exact content creation process. I hope you're able to steal something from it and validate your own great ideas.
