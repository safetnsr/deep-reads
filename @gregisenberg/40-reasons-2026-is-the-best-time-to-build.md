1. Mobile apps are back. AI unlocks new behavior loops like autonomous logging, real-time reasoning, and adaptive UIs impossible in 2015.

2. iOS dev speed is unreal. Opus 4.5, Xcode Gen, Swift Assist, and Nano Banana let a solo builder ship a premium app in days.

3. Consumer AI agents create new categories. Apps that think, plan, and act for you replace half the App Store.

4. Robotics finally becomes buildable. Low-cost arms, wheels, and grippers plus vision-language models turn robotics into a software problem.

5. Anyone can build a creator workflow. ChatGPT + CapCut + Nano Banana make a full studio a button press away.

6. Distribution has no gatekeepers. One sharp short-form video can hit 1 million views with zero followers.

7. TikTok ads become print-money engines. Agents can run 100 variations overnight and find winners for you.

8. Search is wide open. Answer synthesis kills SEO and creates a new category: LLM Optimization.

9. Social AI creates new networks. Infinite-context feeds, AI companions, and dynamic worlds reset what a social app can be.

10. Data asymmetry returns.

 reveals niche spikes, buying intent, and underserved categories before anyone else notices.

11. Agents kill customer support. You can run a 24/7 support org with Retell, Opus Skills, and workflow agents.

12. Micro-SaaS becomes a viable main income. One person with Claude Code and Vercel can do $10K to $50K MRR.

13. Vertical software explodes. AI makes ultra-specific niches profitable like “farm equipment inspectors” or “dog groomer scheduling.”

14. Hardware AI resurges. Earbuds, pins, and wearables create new surfaces for apps and new billion dollar categories.

15. On-device agents remove latency. Apple Neural Engine, Qualcomm Gemini, and local models create instant experiences.

16. Creators become distribution. You can partner with a 20K-follower creator and instantly validate a product.

17. AI makes paid social cheaper. Precise audiences and auto-creative make ROAS predictable for small budgets.

18. Multi-agent workflows create virtual teams. One founder can run a 10-seat company with Opus 4.5 skills, Gemini research, and Perplexity MCPs.

19. Market research is free. You can run 10,000 AI persona simulations before building anything real.

20. Ads become computational. Claude generates copy, Gemini edits, Nano Banana designs, and agents test. You get a full acquisition pipeline for $20.

21. Community-led products dominate. AI tools make it easy to spin up thriving niche communities with automated moderation.

22. Knowledge is free. You can listen to Satya Nadella, Jensen Huang, Brian Chesky, Tobi Lutke, and $10K/month indie builders for free.

23. Robotics + AI creates a gold rush. Cheap hardware and agent planning unlock new physical world startups.

24. Agents act like cofounders. Email, scheduling, research, writing, and code can run without you.

25. App quality goes up. Indie apps match the quality of venture-backed teams through Opus 4.5 interface skills and Nano Banana design assets.

26. The App Store becomes infinite. Micro-apps get generated on demand inside ChatGPT and Gemini. Tons of opportunity building little apps or through new app platforms like Wabi

27. Building in public speeds trust. Short-form videos and transparent updates become acquisition engines.

28. Multi-model workflows outperform single models. Claude + Gemini + ChatGPT together create an unfair advantage.

29. Serverless infra removes dev-ops. Vercel, Railway, Neon, Supabase, and Clerk make backends a dropdown.

30. AI creates blue ocean consumer use cases. Meal planning, life logging, financial agents, habit bots, and autonomous shopping all emerge.

31. Creator apps become plug and play. You can white-label tools for creators in one afternoon.

32. Prototypes close deals. Anti-Gravity can generate clickable demos that look real enough to sell enterprise.

33. Personalization becomes trivial. Agents tailor content, onboarding, pricing, and UX in minutes.

34. Emotional AI is here. Models can detect tone and adapt messaging in real time.

35. Legal and finance become automated. AngelList, Stripe Atlas, and agent-driven bookkeeping remove startup friction.

36. Talent becomes global. You can hire a team of agents plus one human from anywhere.

37. Creator AI agents create distribution loops. Your agent can collaborate with other agents to boost reach.

38. Virality becomes predictable. AI-forward storytelling and hook testing find message-market fit.

39. Onboarding becomes a funnel. Agents walk users through product setup and drive them to activation.

40. Timing arbitrage is massive. Everyone has tools, but almost nobody is using them with taste and judgment. That gap is the opportunity.

2026 is the best time ever to start a startup. I'm rooting for you. Some of the biggest businesses started off as "silly little side projects".
