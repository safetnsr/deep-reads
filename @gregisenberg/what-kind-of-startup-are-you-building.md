I had a realization yesterday over coffee with a friend.

The topic? The age-old debate: product vs. distribution — what's more important?

But as we delved deeper, it became clear — there's a seismic shift in the startup playbook that many aren't noticing.

I described to him the two classic schools of thought:

1. **Product First, Audience Second:** This is the Apple way. Build something so beautiful, so powerful, that people will crawl through glass to get it. Then you just have to tell 'em it exists.

2. **Audience First, Product Second:** Think Instagram influencers turning into fashion moguls. You've got the eyes; now show them something shiny to buy.

Legendary companies have been born from these paths. But, lean in... because they're yesterday's playbook. The game's changed while we were picking teams.

The heavy-hitters of the last few years? They shattered the traditional dichotomy. They embedded distribution into the very fabric of their product.

It isn't one at a time. It isn't product then distribution. It isn't distribution then product. **It's both.**

## Symbiotic Growth

A concept where your product's value proposition and its distribution channel are not just connected; they're conjoined twins. One can't breathe without the other.

**Examples:**

- **Ecosia — The Search Engine that Plants Trees:** A search engine, but every query plants trees. As users championed the environmental cause, they also inadvertently championed Ecosia. Awareness spread not through ads, but through user advocacy. *Insight: Align product growth with a noble cause and it's a multiple on word-of-mouth.*

- **Audible's Shared Clips:** Users share profound or interesting audio snippets on social. The curious ones? They want the whole book. *Insight: Give a taste, sell the meal.*

- **Notion's Template Universe:** Notion didn't just stop at creating an efficient workspace. They allowed users to craft their own universe — with templates. What's clever… every shared template wasn't just productivity; it was a siren call, drawing more to the platform. *Insight: Product goal is to make users your advertisers.*

- **Capcut Showing Off:** Picture this. A Reel, edited with Capcut, hits big on Instagram. Viewers go nuts not just for the content, but for the slick, unique editing. And they wonder, "How?" That's Capcut's silent A+ audition on every platform. *Insight: Embed your signature in user creations.*

- **Airtable's Public Bases:** Organizations share intricate, public bases as showcases. Others, looking for inspiration, end up on Airtable. It's not just a database, it's a bait. *Insight: Public showcases pull in admirers.*

## The Patterns

- **Distribution by Demonstration:** Your product becomes visible during normal use — obvious but often ignored. Think AirPods. They're not just earphones; they're a fashion statement.

- **Decentralized Sales Team:** Your users should be so satisfied that they are willing to convince others to join. Make your users your unpaid salesforce.

- **Product as Network:** Each user adds value to all other users, creating a magnetic pull. Think Facebook, Instagram, Snap. This is community + network effects.

- **Community-Evolved Product:** Let your user base dictate the evolution of your product through feedback loops, open forums, and beta testing. Instead of you pushing changes onto them, pull ideas and refinements from their actual needs and desires. Think about the way games like Minecraft evolved with its community's input. Shared ownership amplifies advocacy and retention.

So the next time you're hunched over your laptop, the coffee's gone cold, and you're plugging away, ask yourself: **"Is my product serving its current user, or is it built to also attract the next 1000?"**

This is not 1+1=2; this is 1+1=11. Symbiotic Growth changes the game. A different state of mind. It's a viral loop that doesn't rely on network effects for scale — it creates its own network effect.

As CEOs, product managers, product designers… thinking about symbiotic growth is a worthwhile endeavor. Definitely something I'm doing more of especially to reduce dependency on ad platforms and paying Zuckerberg the big bucks.

A product isn't great because it's great. It's great because people can't help but bring others to it. That's when you know you've got something. That's when you're not just playing the game, but changing it.

**Small mindset shift, big difference.**
