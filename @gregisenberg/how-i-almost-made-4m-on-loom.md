On Thursday, Loom got bought by Atlassian for $975M in CASH, and here's my little secret:

I passed on investing in their pre-seed round when they were only worth ~$6.5M.

So, my $25k could have turned into a whopping $3M-$4M...ouch.

*(Loom was originally called OpenTest — co-founder Shahed Khan emailed me asking to invest)*

Today, I'll distill what I learned from watching them grow from an idea on a napkin into a mega business.

And maybe you'll be able to create the next Loom.

## 1. The power in starting small and imperfect

Loom, which not many people know was originally called OpenTest, teaches us a simple lesson about the magic of starting, even when things aren't perfect.

In the beginning, it wasn't about having a perfect product or a cool name, but it was all about paying attention to a simple idea I call the **"apple and orange" principle**:

Sometimes we work hard to make an "orange" when your target market would die for an "apple."

When the team saw that OpenTest was hitting a nerve, they made moves, including changing the name to Loom. They let the buzz of finding a product people wanted guide them, teaching me a crucial lesson:

**Quick, messy steps forward are better than waiting around trying to make everything perfect.**

Taking this to heart, my team at Late Checkout adheres to a **30-day launch model**:

1. **Birth of an Idea:** Define the problem, solution, go-to-market strategy, and overarching vision succinctly.
2. **Domain & Social:** Secure your digital real estate without spending cycles on the perfect name.
3. **Design Sprint:** Quickly generate essential design assets.
4. **Testing Demand:** Utilize Framer for a landing page (our experiments spend $1000 per page).
5. **Crafting a Prototype:** Use existing software/APIs/SDKs to create a prototype. Faster and cheaper to get to market.

Starting small and embracing early imperfections isn't just a methodology; it's the secret sauce.

## 2. Diversification fuels wealth

This was my response to Shahed when he asked if I wanted to invest: "No thanks."

*(Brutal for me to re-read this)*

Hit pause and rewind with me for a moment: Seeing my "no thanks" to an early stab at investing in Shahed's venture kinda stings now, and it serves up a spicy life lesson I wasn't expecting.

"The best founders stay focused" whispered the VCs I looked up to, pushing the narrative that loading all my chips on a single VC-backed business was the golden ticket to startup stardom.

Time to spill the tea on a less spoken truth:

**VCs chanting 'focus' might be doing wonders... for their wallets, not yours.** Their strategy leans heavily on your all-or-nothing dive. But when you peek behind the curtain at the skinny odds haunting even the sparkliest VC-backed startups, you realize: putting all your dreams in one startup basket? Maybe not so dreamy.

Here's the gut-check I'm sending back in time to younger me:

Don't let your entrepreneurial spirit chain you to just one dream. Picture yourself as an investment portfolio, a smorgasbord of ventures shielding you from the rollercoaster that is the startup world.

Fast forward to my now: I'm surrounded by a thriving jungle of community-driven, profit-pulling ventures. My past self, hyper-focused on building one business, has evolved into a version of me that nurtures a varied portfolio.

**Smart diversification isn't just shrewd; it's a safety net.**

## 3. Be Community-Obsessed with Making Things Better

When I'd run into Loom's founders, Joe, Vinay, and Shahed, the conversation was never focused around iterating on the product for the community.

- They never talked about fundraising
- They never talked about optimizing valuation
- They never talked about M&A

**Product over everything.**

They constantly tweaked and adjusted, always with an ear to their community, never just chasing a big payday.

The payday was the iteration.

And iteration pays off.
