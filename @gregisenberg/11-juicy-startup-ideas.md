You're hungry for startup ideas, fresh ones, the kind that make you slap your forehead and say, "Why didn't I think of that?."

Well, my friend, you've come to the right place.

Here are 11 free ideas that might just set your brain on fire….

## The Ideas

**1. 'Creator's League'**

This ain't your daddy's NBA. Imagine a sports league, not with burly athletes, but with top creators, YouTube legends, TikTok phenoms. Not on the hardwood, but the digital arena. What if you could watch Mr. Beast instead of Lebron? Logan Paul's boxing match showed that when creators throw punches, people tune in. So why not provide these creators with a different kind of court, their own league? They get a share of the earnings, of course (and way less bruising than boxing). Business model? Sell it as a YouTube pay-per-view or go Netflix-style subscription or make it free and pull in the sponsorships.

**2. 'FarmCart'**

As health-conscious and eco-minded consumers, we crave organic, locally-sourced foods. It's one thing to browse a sunny farmer's market on a Saturday afternoon, but let's be real, it's not as convenient as Instacart. What if you could bring the farmer's market to people's doorstep? People will pay for the convenience, and local farmers get a broader, more accessible market. Local is all the rage, people just need an app to make it happen for them. Probably gets acquired by Instacart.

**3. 'Saint Decaf'**

Decaf lovers, this one's for you. In a world where non-alcoholic beer morphed from niche to a $22B market in 2022, there's untapped potential in decaf coffee. But where's the leading decaf brand? Nowhere, it seems. Someone needs to step up and claim this space. You smell opportunity? I smell decaf.

**4. 'SubSpotlight'**

Subscribers aren't just numbers; they're people, sometimes with incredible stories, vast resources, and sparkling influence. Discover your VIPs among your subscriber base and engage with them. Out of my 70k subscribers, I found billionaires and childhood heroes! I would pay to find and connect with these VIPs, wouldn't you? Also, say hi to me if you're reading this my VIPs.

**5. 'HaggleBot'**

No one likes the awkward haggling dance, whether it's at a local market or with service providers. What if an AI bot could do the haggling for you, saving your time and money in the process? The business model? A percentage of the savings it generates. In a world ruled by convenience, I'd sign up in a heartbeat.

**6. 'SmokeGuard'**

Smoke detectors haven't changed since the 80s. They're functional, sure, but aren't they due for a 21st-century makeover? We need a Nest for smoke detectors — smart, reliable, and contemporary. An overlooked market? Absolutely. Opportunity? You bet.

**7. 'IWouldVouch'**

In an age of LinkedIn and digital portfolios, traditional reference letters are gathering dust. What would a modern-day reference letter look like? Something validated, social, visually appealing, and easy to share, perhaps. Recognition of our personality and abilities in real-time sounds like a better deal than a stale, formal letter, doesn't it?

**8. 'Moody'**

In this age of information overload, a well-curated Pinterest mood board can be a breath of fresh air. Whether for home decor inspiration or content ideas, people would pay a flat fee for this service. Curation is king in an AI-dominated world.

**9. 'EduLoot' — Gamifying Education with Loot Boxes**

It's no secret that learning can be, well, a little dry. But what if it weren't? Imagine an educational platform that uses the thrill of loot boxes to boost engagement. Monthly subscription. Each completed lesson or achieved milestone unlocks a loot box filled with e-books, exclusive webinars, or cool study gadgets. It's learning meets gaming, and it just might be the shake-up education needs (and get you some recurring revenue).

**10. 'Ghost Town Revival' — Renovating and Monetizing Ghost Towns**

Thousands of ghost towns exist around the world, abandoned and forgotten. These could be turned into unique tourist attractions, immersive history learning experiences, or even themed accommodation for adventurous travelers. The business would handle the purchase, renovation, and marketing of these towns.

**11. 'BeyondEnglish' — Language Learning for Less Common Languages**

There are plenty of platforms to learn Spanish, French, or Mandarin, but what about Basque, Quechua or Yiddish? 'BeyondEnglish' could cater to the untapped communities of people interested in learning less common languages, with native speakers providing the instruction.

## A simple, actionable framework to get you started

1. **Spot the Fringes:** Look at niche communities, subreddits, comment sections, and corners of the internet that aren't mainstream. Unconventional ideas often come from unconventional places.
2. **Embrace the Unorthodox:** Tradition and habit can limit innovation. Step outside of your comfort zone, challenge existing assumptions, and question the "normal" way of doing things. Abnormal pays.
3. **Solve the "Hidden" Problems:** The most profound innovations often come from addressing problems that people didn't even realize they had. Pay attention to the subtle inconveniences and inefficiencies in people's lives.
4. **Make It Personal:** Use your own experiences, frustrations, and aspirations as a source of inspiration. Solutions born out of personal necessity often resonate with others.
5. **Experiment and Iterate:** The first version of your idea will probably suck, and that's okay. Use feedback, criticism, and failure as tools for refinement. [Use a social post as your MVP.](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/why-your-next-business-idea-is-a)

Via [Jeremy Giffon](https://twitter.com/jeremygiffon/status/1663945171724009473?s=20): Goldman built their building with generators so it could work entirely off the grid. So when Hurricane Sandy hit NY they were able to keep operating when no one else could. Just shows how their self-conception is so different from everyone else.
