Two ways to create a winning business:

1. Hire the right talent
2. Don't run out of cash

Let's tackle a bit of #1 and #2 today — how to hire great people at 2-3x cheaper than usual.

Your team is your lifeblood.

Especially true in an internet business (where your teams are usually more compact).

Instagram sold for $1B with 13 employees. WhatsApp sold for $19B with 55 employees. Each employee matters so much in internet businesses. Less is more.

So the question becomes, "How do you reverse engineer the world's greatest team for your business?"

At Late Checkout, we use the **95/5 rule**.

5% of our hires are "been there done that" expensive hires (often our operators of our businesses or senior talent), 95% are these non-traditional hires.

There are two checklists you can use when interviewing potential hires: the standard interview questions, or non-obvious traits.

You know the standard interview questions. They're what most businesses look for.

- What school did you go to?
- Where have you worked before?
- What did you learn at XYZ school or workplace?

Proven candidates who have "been there and done that."

The downside of viewing hiring in this way is typically you have to pay a lot more money for these hires. It's not uncommon for the average Meta employee to make $400k+… and that's a lot of money if you're pre-product-market fit.

Another downside that I've seen personally is they tend to be less loyal than other candidates. They're more likely to be looking for the next big thing and won't hesitate to jump ship.

These matter a bit, but I put much more stock in a different kind of resume…

## 6 Questions to Dig Up Non-Obvious Traits

Sure, Harvard and Google look great on a traditional resume — but these non-obvious traits tell me much more about what kind of team member you'll be.

**1. Have you made money as an affiliate?**

This shows your ability to hustle on the internet. If you can sell anything online and make win-win business relationships, you can find your place in a larger company structure.

It could be selling stuff via your Instagram or doing more complex ad arbitrage.

Either way, being an affiliate tells me you're from "the streets" of the internet. You graduated the school of hard knocks.

**2. Have you sold stuff on eBay?**

This shows that you understand copywriting for the internet, pricing strategy, and the ability to communicate with others. Plus, the importance of good customer service (need those 5-star reviews.)

**3. Have you run a successful meme page?**

You can write for the internet and specific niches within it. You can connect with wide ranges of people, foster community, and take marketing projects from zero to one.

**4. Have you launched a product?**

Whether it's something as simple as a DTC t-shirt brand or you've coded a SaaS project, the ability to take products from zero to one is a rare, invaluable skill.

Zero-to-one is a completely different skillset than 1-to-N. Most big companies are full of 1-to-N people.

**5. Were you in any gaming clans/teams/guilds?**

It's essentially the internet version of youth sports, plus the community aspect of building respect and authority through chat rooms. Teamwork, strategy, communication all come through in online gaming.

So much of what I've become as a CEO I learned becoming a leader of clans in Counter Strike.

**6. Have you hosted events?**

Think about all that goes into setting up a party:

- Who's invited?
- How many people are invited?
- What time does it start?
- Where's it at?
- How do you set up the space?
- What kind of food and where's it coming from?
- What's the playlist?
- How do you create mystery?

Building community is just setting up parties on the internet.

These non-obvious traits might not get you an interview at Facebook — but in my opinion, they're true indicators of success when it comes to building on the internet.
