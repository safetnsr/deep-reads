## in a world where AI slop is everywhere and it’s easier than ever to build software

the value of design mimicry (clone aesthetics) goes down

the value of top-of-funnel vanity metrics goes down

do you agree?

Observations:

This is a trust compression moment not just a "tools got better" moment. When software becomes cheap and abundant, the human brain flips its filtering strategy. People stop asking “is this possible?” and start asking “who is behind this?” and “why should I believe this will work for me?” That’s why brands, communities, and known operators quietly matter more than raw features. Trust becomes the real onboarding.

There’s also a timing effect people underestimate. In a world flooded with AI output, speed to market matters less than speed to clarity. The winning remove doubt faster. They feel opinionated, narrow, and almost stubborn. They trade breadth for conviction. This is why niche products feel calmer and convert better: they reduce decision fatigue instead of contributing to it.

Another subtle shift: distribution is about repetition. Seeing the same idea, tool, or person show up consistently across contexts builds familiarity faster than any single viral spike.

This favors founders who think like media operators and media operators who think like product builders. The loop tightens when content isn’t just marketing, but proof of work, proof of thinking, and proof of continuity.

Fiiiiinally, the biggest unlock is psychological. When everything looks copyable, people stop competing on originality and start competing on alignment. Who understands my situation? Who speaks my language? Who feels like they’re building with me, not at me? That alignment is hard to manufacture and impossible to scale with ads alone. It’s earned slowly, then compounds quietly.

This is why niche ideas will work really well in 2026 and beyond. And why more startup ideas work now than ever (and why you should sign up to

TLDR;

this is the new normal. AI slop, AI slop everywhere.

what’s happening underneath this list is a quiet inversion of how value is created.

but if you look closely, there is tons of arbritrage in an AI slop world

and that fires me up.

I choose to look at the glass half full. Yes there is AI slop everywhere but...

it's time to build.
