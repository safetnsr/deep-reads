Simple, right? Almost too simple.

Our conversion rate jumped to 4.2% overnight.

That's a 180% increase. From changing THREE words.

We weren't asking for their time anymore. We were offering them value. And the word "request" felt more luxury.

Suddenly, it wasn't about us. It was about them.

I was hooked.

I started seeing buttons everywhere. Not in a creepy way, but you know what I mean.

Take a friend's high-end coffee subscription service. Their button said "Subscribe Now." Yawn.

We changed it to **"Unlock Your Coffee Journey."**

Subscriptions tripled in a month.

People weren't just buying coffee anymore. They were embarking on a caffeinated adventure.

But it's not always smooth sailing.

We tried the same trick with a friend's fitness app. Changed "Start Workout" to "Unleash Your Inner Athlete."

Crickets.

Turns out, people just wanted to work out, not contemplate their athletic potential at 6 AM.

Lesson learned: know your community. Of course.

Now, I'm obsessed. I analyze buttons like some people analyze stock charts.

- Nike doesn't want you to 'Shop'. They challenge you to **'Find Your Greatness'**.
- Airbnb doesn't ask you to "Search". They invite you to **"Explore nearby stays"**.
- Noom doesn't say 'Start Diet'. They encourage you to **'Start Your Quiz'**.

Each one? A micro masterpiece of persuasion.

## Here's my framework on designing buttons that drive impact:

1. What does the community really want from you?
2. How can I give it to them?
3. How can I make it sound exciting?

**Remember: People don't want to buy your product. They want to buy a better version of themselves.**

So next time you're designing a button, don't just tell them what to do.

Show them what they'll become.

Your bank account will thank you.
