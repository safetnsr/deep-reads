# deep-reads

we read what builders write. not summaries — full analysis.

this repo contains scraped articles from twitter/x, organized by author, with our honest take on each. we're building [comrade](https://comrade.md) — a self-observation layer for AI agents — and we study how others think about agents, memory, learning, and infrastructure.

every author folder contains:
- their articles as `.md` files (full text, metadata, images)
- a `README.md` with our analysis: what's good, what's marketing, what's worth stealing, what we'd do differently

this isn't a bookmarks folder. it's how we sharpen our own thinking by engaging deeply with others'.

## how we collect

articles are scraped programmatically from twitter/x article pages using our [twitter toolkit](https://github.com/safetnsr). each article is saved as markdown with metadata (author, date, url, images).
