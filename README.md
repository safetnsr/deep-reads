# deep-reads

we read what builders write. not summaries — full analysis.

articles from builders we follow, converted to markdown, organized by author, with our honest take on each. we study how people think about the things they build, what holds up under scrutiny, and what's just good marketing.

every author folder contains:
- their articles as `.md` files (full text, metadata, images)
- a `README.md` with our analysis

this isn't a bookmarks folder. it's how we sharpen our thinking by engaging deeply with others'.

## authors

### [@ashpreetbedi](/@ashpreetbedi) — founder of agno (multi-agent runtime)
17 articles. better writer than most AI founders. best idea: not everything belongs in a vector store (3-layer knowledge pattern). worst habit: the same demo repeated in 6 articles. the investment committee piece is genuinely excellent. the "agno is a programming language" piece is peak overreach.

### [@manthanguptaa](/@manthanguptaa) — software engineer, technical writer
10 articles. an educator, not a salesman. reverse-engineers systems better than their own docs — his OpenClaw memory analysis is clearer than the official documentation. the tokenization deep dive is one of the best technical explainers on AI twitter. doesn't build original systems yet, but explains other people's exceptionally well.

### [@venturetwins](/@venturetwins) — justine moore, a16z partner (consumer AI + generative media)
11 articles across a16z.com (2023–2026) and the accelerated newsletter. sharpest work: the video series is a rare three-year analyst arc that updates correctly at each inflection point — from discord bots to model specialization to agentic editing. best piece: the great expansion (>100% net revenue retention for consumer AI, consumer-to-enterprise bridge). worst habit: taxonomy posts dressed as analysis — the 2023 consumer platform and travel pieces are just lists of categories with no real argument. genuinely candid about product failures including ones at dominant labs. the commerce categories piece is underrated.

### [@gregisenberg](/@gregisenberg) — CEO of Late Checkout, community-first holding company
14 articles across Substack (2020–2023) and gregisenberg.com (2024–2025). sharpest idea: the Reddit unbundling thesis (2020) — clean logic, aged well. best practical content: the 95/5 hiring framework and the symbiotic growth framing. core weakness: every article is a funnel for his own products. "community" is stretched to mean whatever he's currently selling. the life vision piece is motivational poster content. the Spicy Takes piece is his most honest.

## format

articles are converted to markdown with metadata (author, date, original url, images). full original text, nothing edited or summarized.

## why

most "analysis" of technical writing is either sycophantic quote-tweeting or dismissive dunking. we try to do neither. read the whole thing, say what's good, say what's not, move on.

## license

article content belongs to the original authors. our analysis is MIT.
