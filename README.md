# deep-reads

we read what builders write. not summaries — full analysis.

articles from builders we follow, converted to markdown, organized by author, with our honest take on each. we study how people think about the things they build, what holds up under scrutiny, and what's just good marketing.

every author folder contains:
- their articles as `.md` files (full text, metadata, images)
- a `README.md` with our analysis and deep links to specific sections

this isn't a bookmarks folder. it's how we sharpen our thinking by engaging deeply with others'.

## authors

### [@ashpreetbedi](/@ashpreetbedi) — founder of agno (multi-agent runtime)
17 articles (X Articles). better writer than most AI founders. best idea: not everything belongs in a vector store ([3-layer knowledge pattern](/@ashpreetbedi/README.md#worth-stealing-for-anyone-building-agent-systems)). worst habit: the same demo repeated in 6 articles. the [investment committee piece](/@ashpreetbedi/why-an-investment-committee.md) is genuinely excellent. the ["agno is a programming language" piece](/@ashpreetbedi/what-makes-a-programming-language.md) is peak overreach.

### [@manthanguptaa](/@manthanguptaa) — software engineer, technical writer
10 articles (X Articles). an educator, not a salesman. reverse-engineers systems better than their own docs — his [OpenClaw memory analysis](/@manthanguptaa/how-context-is-built.md) is clearer than the official documentation. the [tokenization deep dive](/@manthanguptaa/what-is-tokenization.md) is one of the best technical explainers on AI twitter. doesn't build original systems yet, but explains other people's exceptionally well.

### [@gregisenberg](/@gregisenberg) — CEO of Late Checkout, community-first holding company
19 articles (14 Substack/blog + 5 X Articles). sharpest idea: the [reddit unbundling thesis](/@gregisenberg/the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit.md) (2020) — clean logic, aged well. best practical content: the [95/5 hiring framework](/@gregisenberg/why-i-no-longer-hire-from-harvard.md) and the [symbiotic growth framing](/@gregisenberg/what-kind-of-startup-are-you-building.md). his X Articles reveal a coherent 2026 worldview: trust compression, mobile app renaissance, audience-first compounding. core weakness: every article is a funnel — 3-5 product plugs per newsletter, 40+ across the corpus. "community" is stretched to mean whatever he's currently selling. [full analysis →](/@gregisenberg/README.md)

### [@venturetwins](/@venturetwins) — justine moore, a16z partner (consumer AI + generative media)
15 articles (11 a16z.com/newsletter + 4 X Articles). sharpest work: the video series is a rare three-year analyst arc that updates correctly at each inflection point — from discord bots to [model specialization](/@venturetwins/there-is-no-god-tier-video-model.md) to [agentic editing](/@venturetwins/its-time-for-agentic-video-editing.md). best piece: [the great expansion](/@venturetwins/the-great-expansion.md) (>100% net revenue retention, consumer-to-enterprise bridge). her X Articles add a practitioner dimension — the [kling 2.6 tutorial](/@venturetwins/kling-26-motion-control.md) shows hands-on model expertise, and [the gap is enormous](/@venturetwins/the-gap-is-enormous.md) is her most self-disclosing piece (50/50 vibe coding success rate).

## format

articles are converted to markdown with metadata (author, date, original url, images). full original text, nothing edited or summarized. sources include substack, personal blogs, a16z.com, and X Articles (twitter long-form posts).

## why

most "analysis" of technical writing is either sycophantic quote-tweeting or dismissive dunking. we try to do neither. read the whole thing, say what's good, say what's not, move on.

## license

article content belongs to the original authors. our analysis is MIT.
