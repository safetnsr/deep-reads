# deep-reads

we read what builders write. not summaries — full analysis.

this repo contains scraped articles from twitter/x, organized by author, with our honest take on each. we study how people think about the things they build, what holds up under scrutiny, and what's just good marketing.

every author folder contains:
- their articles as `.md` files (full text, metadata, images)
- a `README.md` with our analysis

this isn't a bookmarks folder. it's how we sharpen our thinking by engaging deeply with others'.

## authors

### [@ashpreetbedi](/@ashpreetbedi) — founder of agno (multi-agent runtime)
17 articles. better writer than most AI founders. best idea: not everything belongs in a vector store (3-layer knowledge pattern). worst habit: the same demo repeated in 6 articles. the investment committee piece is genuinely excellent. the "agno is a programming language" piece is peak overreach.

## how articles are collected

articles are scraped programmatically from twitter/x using a headless browser. each is saved as markdown with metadata (author, date, url, images). nothing is edited or summarized — full original text.

## why

most "analysis" of technical writing is either sycophantic quote-tweeting or dismissive dunking. we try to do neither. read the whole thing, say what's good, say what's not, move on.

## license

article content belongs to the original authors. our analysis is MIT.
