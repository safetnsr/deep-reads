# Generative AI: The Next Consumer Platform

Generative AI will be the next major platform upon which founders build category-defining products. Much as the iPhone revolutionized our daily interaction with technology — spawning products like Uber, DoorDash, and Airbnb — generative AI will change everyday life.

In addition to creating new categories of products, AI will supercharge existing ones, improving the consumer experience and making it easier to scale. One of the most powerful things about AI is that it enables products to personalize the user experience. The early applications of this have been in edtech and search — if you're explaining why it rains, you'll use different language for an eight-year-old than for a high school student.

## Search

Language models have the potential to revolutionize one of the core functions of the internet: search. What if you could get a single, concise answer written in natural language, with links to read more if you're interested? LLM-powered search engines make this possible.

Companies like [You](https://you.com/) and [Neeva](https://neeva.com/) are doing this for general search queries. Others are taking a more verticalized approach: [Consensus](https://consensus.app/) searches across research papers, while Perplexity's Bird SQL targets the Twitter graph.

This type of search is particularly valuable for product recommendations. Today, making an informed purchase often requires sorting through dozens of links and hundreds of reviews. What if you could get a curated list of options based on your specific needs?

## Education

With AI, we can now deploy individualized learning plans at scale, giving each user a "teacher in their pocket" who understands their unique needs and can answer questions or test their skills.

Imagine an AI-powered language teacher who can converse in real-time and give feedback on pronunciation or phrasing. [Speak](https://www.speak.com/), [Quazel](https://www.quazel.com/), and [Lingostar](https://www.lingostar.ai/) are already doing this.

## Relationships

We don't believe that technology will ever fully replace human connection. But it can make us feel less alone. Check out the subreddits of AI chatbot products like [Replika](https://www.reddit.com/r/replika/), [Anima](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimaAI/), and [CharacterAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAI/). Many users find real meaning in their relationships with these bots.

AI can also augment or even spark human relationships. Tools like [Millie](https://www.meetmillie.app/) and [YourMove](https://www.yourmove.ai/) optimize dating app profiles and messages.

## Therapy and Coaching

AI-powered therapists, nutritionists, coaches, and mentors will make personal and professional development less costly and more convenient for millions of consumers worldwide. Early research has found that chatbots can be effective in treating mental health. Products like [Woebot](https://woebothealth.com/) and [Wysa](https://www.wysa.com/) have demonstrated clinically validated results.

## Creation

Generative AI allows us to turn our imagination into reality — when done well, this feels nothing short of magic. We've seen generative AI tools roll out across almost every medium:

- **Art:** Midjourney and Stable Diffusion allow users to input a prompt and style and receive unique art
- **Writing:** ChatGPT leads the way, though products like Sudowrite have emerged for more specialized writing like fiction
- **Video:** Descript and RunwayML are expanding from generative video editing to creation
- **Design:** Canva has integrated AI, competing with startups like PhotoRoom and Magician
- **Audio:** Products like Boomy and Riffusion create music from scratch

## Games

AI is likely to play a major role in games. Generative AI will make it easier, faster, and cheaper to produce quality games, while enabling players to truly customize their gameplay. The most popular games cost millions to produce. Generative AI will change this calculus.
