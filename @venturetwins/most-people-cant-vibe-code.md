# Most People Can't Vibe Code. Here's How We Fix That.

*(Note: This is one of Justine Moore's most recent pieces, published February 2026. The full text was paywalled during retrieval — below is a reconstruction based on available snippets and search descriptions.)*

The premise: Andrej Karpathy coined the term "vibe coding" — using AI tools to build software through natural language prompts rather than writing code by hand. The pitch is democratization: anyone can now build apps.

The reality: most people still can't do it well.

The article argues that the gap isn't about AI capability — the models are good enough. It's about workflow, UI, and onboarding. The barriers are:

1. **Non-technical users don't know how to prompt for software.** Knowing what you want built and knowing how to describe it to an AI in a way that produces working code are different skills.

2. **Debugging vibe-coded apps is brutal for beginners.** When the AI produces wrong or broken code, a non-technical user has no idea how to diagnose the problem. The current tools surface errors but don't explain them in ways laypeople understand.

3. **Deployment and ops remain technical.** Getting an app from "running locally" to "accessible on the internet" still requires understanding of DNS, hosting, environment variables, and other concepts that are invisible to non-technical users.

The proposed fixes center on building smarter scaffolding around the AI generation: better error explanations, guided debugging workflows, one-click deployment, and better templates that let non-technical users start from a working product rather than from nothing.

Companies Justine is watching in this space: Bolt, Lovable, Replit, and others building towards true no-code → code pipelines.

The larger thesis: **the real unlock for "everyone can build software" isn't just better models — it's better product design around those models.** The best analogy is early smartphones. The iPhone's hardware was important, but the App Store, intuitive UX, and absence of a command line were what democratized mobile computing.
