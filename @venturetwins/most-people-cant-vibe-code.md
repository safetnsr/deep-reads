vibe coding promised to democratize software engineering. instead, it's created a new class of power users without touching everyday consumers.

we are living through a golden age of software. people are shipping insanely cool apps in an afternoon, automating their entire lives with agents, and prompting tools that would've taken a dev team months.

but the people drawn to vibe coding are largely developers, founders, designers, and PMs. they're daily active users of X, fans of karpathy's youtube videos, or regular listeners to dwarkesh. they know what a terminal is.

that's maybe 1% of the population.

most people still think AI = ChatGPT. if they do see one of these vibe coding demos, it's like a video of someone doing a backflip — cool to see, but not something they're going to try at home.

try to put yourself in the mindset of someone who has never coded before. this is going to be difficult if you're technical or even tech-adjacent – you've internalized so many things that the average person has never encountered.

## the non-technical mindset

ben tossell wrote a great post that may help you understand the mindset of a non-technical user.

i have zero engineering background, so i'm a good test case. i'd never interacted with either a CLI or an IDE before i started vibe coding. now, my success rate is probably 50/50 on the projects i start. i spend a lot of time dragging screenshots and copying error messages into cursor and asking for help.

take openclaw (formerly clawdbot). to run it, you need a separate machine (mac mini or VPS), terminal access, and the ability to configure your own security protocols. did i get it up and running? yes. am i using it to its full potential? absolutely not.

i'm not the only one who has struggled with vibe coding – in fact, we may be the silent majority. i came across a blog post from a writer that captures this perfectly. he was trying to vibecode an app to pull quotes from his newsletter. after getting off to a solid start, he quickly ran into problems.

he got further than most non-technical people ever would – but still ended up frustrated, and feeling unsuccessful. this is not the kind of experience that takes a product mainstream.

## from unix to products

matt rickard wrote years ago that every unix command eventually becomes a startup. technical people build powerful but arcane tools, then someone packages them for everyone else.

we're in the unix era of AI agents. the raw capabilities are incredible – but they're buried under terminal commands, API keys, and YAML configs. enter the product layer.

companies like poke (by interaction company) and wabi get this. poke built an AI assistant that lives in iMessage – no setup, and no terminal. you just text it. wabi is building what CEO eugenia kuyda calls "youtube for apps" – a platform where you can prompt an app into existence and share it with friends. no integrations, authentication, or API keys required.

these aren't tools for developers. they're products for people. tools give you capabilities to build something yourself. products give you the outcome you're looking for.

## the four problems

building for consumers is harder than building for developers. developers will work through complex problems and tolerate rough interfaces, while consumers will abandon a product if a page takes too long to load. you can ship tools to developers – but you need to ship products to consumers.

### the setup problem
developers will SSH into a server, configure environment variables, manage dependencies. consumers need zero-setup: open browser, start building. everything runs in the cloud, sandboxed and secure by default.

### the security problem
veracode's 2025 report found that nearly half of all AI-generated code contains security vulnerabilities. developers might catch these. consumers won't. as one researcher put it: applications built through vibe coding are "often built by inexperienced users, who either don't configure the runtime environment at all, or configure it according to advice from the same AI." consumer products need guardrails baked in—not opt-in security that requires expertise.

### the imagination problem
this one's underrated. developers often know what they want to do with a coding agent and have mental models for what software can do. non-technical people can't even imagine what they can create. the best consumer products will help people discover what's possible—templates, use cases, or a feed of "what people like you built this week."

### the deployment problem
many consumers struggle to understand how to deploy a product they've built (hence the "localhost" meme). consumer tools need to collapse this complexity entirely—you hit "done" and your thing exists in the world.

## the opportunity

almost everyone uses software. very few people have ever built it. that's starting to change with vibe coding—but so far, it's only come for people who are already somewhat technical.

the startups that figure out vibe coding for consumers will do what squarespace did for websites and canva did for design: take something that requires expertise and make it accessible.

right now, vibe coding is a spectator sport for most of america. someone's going to build the on-ramp. when they do, we won't just have more developers—we'll have millions of people building software who never thought they could.
