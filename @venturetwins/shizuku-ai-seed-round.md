In January 2023, while still completing his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley, Akio Kodaira launched an AI VTuber named Shizuku on YouTube.

Shizuku could chat with viewers in Japanese and English, sing songs, and respond in real time with a Live2D avatar. Akio (who goes by

 here on X) ran dozens of streams, building a community of thousands of followers who tuned in to talk with an AI character that actually felt present.

At the time, this seemed like a hobby project. In retrospect, it was a proof of concept for something much bigger—which became clear if you looked at Akio’s body of research.

He was the lead author on StreamDiffusion, a breakthrough paper that achieved real-time image generation at over 90 fps (fast enough for streaming video). The

 has over 10,000 stars on GitHub and was published at ICCV 2025. Then, Akio trained models for real-time interactive video at Meta and worked on video research at Luma.

And now, he's launching Shizuku AI. The company is building an AI lab in Japan dedicated to developing AI companions and characters—combining cutting-edge research with the artistic sensibility that has made Japanese character design beloved worldwide.

The initial focus is on Shizuku (

) herself: expanding her capabilities with multilingual voice synthesis, richer conversational AI, and presence across platforms like Discord, YouTube, and X.

Akio is tackling a fundamental challenge facing AI companions today: they lack the data to generate truly engaging, proactive conversations, which makes interactions feel monotonous. By deploying Shizuku across multiple platforms and building a community that participates in her evolution, the team is creating the feedback loop needed to solve this problem.

The community-driven approach is intentional. Akio believes that characters worth loving can’t be built in isolation—they need to grow through relationships with real people, just as the most iconic characters in Japanese entertainment have always evolved through the bond between creators and fans.

Akio has the rare combination of world-class technical ability, deep cultural intuition about what makes characters resonate, and years of hands-on experience actually building and operating an AI character that people want to spend time with. Most founders have one of these. Akio has all three.

Growing up in Japan, Akio was shaped by stories of humans coexisting with artificial life: Doraemon, Mega Man Battle Network, and countless anime where AI companions weren’t just tools but partners and friends. He watched Hatsune Miku become a global phenomenon, proving that Japanese characters could transcend language and culture. And he became convinced that AI would eventually make these fictional relationships real.
