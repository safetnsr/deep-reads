# It's Time for Agentic Video Editing

2025 was the year of video. AI-generated ads went mainstream. Launch videos from seed stage startups got millions of views. Video podcasts and interviews exploded.

What you didn't see was all the work behind the scenes. Cutting 90 minutes of footage into a three-minute short. Correcting lighting and audio in post-production because you couldn't nail it in the shoot. Searching for the right music and sound effects.

A common rule of thumb in video production is that you'll spend **80% of your time & energy on editing, and 20% on filming** (or now, generating). Crafting compelling video is typically a long and tedious process — and few people have the "taste" to do it right. There's a significant barrier to entry.

We now have the technology to hand over some of this work to AI agents, which can help us produce both filmed and generated content. Vision models can watch and comprehend massive amounts of video footage. Agents can analyze, plan, and use editing tools on your behalf. And we have enough training data to teach models what makes a video great.

**What Cursor did for coding, these agents will do for video production.**

## What's Unlocked Progress

A few recent developments have made agentic video editing possible:

- **Vision models can now process large amounts of video.** Gemini 3 can now process up to an hour of video — you can upload it as input and ask the model to generate timestamped labels, find a specific moment, or summarize what's happening.

- **Models can now use tools.** AI video editors need to be able to take action — not just describe what's happening or suggest changes. One of the best examples is [Claude using Blender](https://x.com/sidahuj/status/1899460492999184534).

- **Image and video generation models have improved.** Many video production pipelines will be hybrid — a mix of AI and filmed content. Imagine filming interviews for a documentary, but generating B-roll or historical footage with AI.

## What Agents Will Be Able to Tackle

**Process** — sorting through footage, organizing it, deciding what to use. Products like [Eddie AI](https://www.heyeddie.ai/) can take hours of uploaded video and identify A-roll vs. B-roll, process multiple camera angles, and compare takes.

**Orchestrate** — if videos include some element of AI, we need agents that orchestrate all of the models. Imagine: you want to add an AI animation to an educational video. An agent generates the images, sends them to a video model, and stitches the outputs together. Products like [Glif](https://glif.app/agents) are launching agents that coordinate between multiple models.

**Polish** — fixing the small details that take a video from good to great. Products like [Descript](http://descript.com/)'s Underlord agent can take a video, make changes (adjust lighting between clips, clean audio noise, take out filler words), and deliver the final version.

**Adapt** — when you make a good video, it makes sense to adapt it for more reach. You may want to cut a YouTube podcast into short clips with different aspect ratios for X, Instagram, and TikTok. Platforms like [Overlap](http://overlap.ai/) allow you to set up node workflows for these adaptation tasks.

**Optimize** — the ultimate goal isn't just replacing manual tasks with AI, it's building agents with taste that can make your videos better. YouTuber Emma Chamberlain famously said she used to spend 30-40 hours editing a ~15 minute vlog. What if an AI agent could watch your footage, ask about your objectives, and then craft a few draft versions for you to iterate on? You review and direct — "The opening is too slow." "Make the ending hit harder" — and the agent executes.

## The Conclusion

Video has won. It's how we learn, market, and connect. But the editing bottleneck keeps growing. More footage captured, more platforms to publish on, more formats required.

The good news is that technology to solve this exists. Vision models, tool-using agents, and massive amounts of training data have all matured in the past year. The pieces are in place.

This means that AI editing agents will dramatically increase the quality of all video we see in the coming months and years, along with the rate at which it's created.

2025 was the year of video. 2026 is the year we let agents edit it.
