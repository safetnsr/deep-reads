# "Adventure is out there!": Opportunities in AI x Travel

Travel is a trillion-dollar industry stuck in the past. The last major breakthrough came in the 1990s, with the emergence of online travel agencies (OTAs) like Booking.com and Expedia to aggregate inventory. Unless you hire a travel agent, planning is still a manual and time-intensive process — until now.

We believe that the travel industry is perfectly positioned to ride the wave of AI. There's a wealth of public data on almost every destination, form of transportation, restaurant, and activity — including objective facts like hours, pricing, and location, as well as opinions or tips from reviews.

Then there is your own private data on how you like to travel (window or aisle seat?), where you've already been, and your favorite destinations or experiences. Combine this public and private information, and you have an exceptional dataset to power future recommendations that are customized to each individual.

## Using AI for Inspiration

Sometimes the hardest part of planning a trip is choosing where (and when) to go. Imagine typing a request in natural language — "two-week summer beach trip within driving distance that costs less than $1,000" — and getting a curated list of destinations.

The products are basic today, but we expect they'll become full-featured and interactive. As these tools become more advanced, they'll tap into your personal data. Why shouldn't a travel app connect to your calendar to understand where you've already visited, or to find the least busy week for you to take a trip?

Eventually, these tools may become proactive. Imagine an "always on" chatbot that's constantly scanning for opportunities that match your preferences and calendar. It could make smart recommendations like "Tack on two days of skiing at the end of your work trip for $500," or even "Three of your closest friends are free the same weekend, here's a trip idea."

## Using AI for Itinerary Planning

Once you've picked where to go, it's time to set an itinerary. There's no way you can scan all of the options for activities and dining, and read every online review, but an AI can! People are [already using](https://twitter.com/lyemcfly/status/1620411266237071360) ChatGPT for itineraries and the results are surprisingly strong.

Products in this space will need to tackle the "correctness" issue — models sometimes hallucinate (e.g., recommending a restaurant that doesn't exist) or serve outdated information. Potential solutions:

- After receiving a recommended itinerary, the product could have built-in checks to ensure accuracy before delivering it to the consumer
- Purpose-built models trained on a limited dataset that are more restricted and can't make up information
- Generated itineraries could be published to a broader community for validation

## Using AI for Booking

When you've set your itinerary and are ready to book, AI assistants can optimize the process. The next problem to solve is booking automation. What if a tool could make bookings for you? At first, any booking bot will likely need significant guidance, but these bots will become more autonomous over time.

AI tools also can scrape the internet to find the best place to book: should you go directly to the vendor's website, or is an aggregator offering a discount?

## Using AI While on the Trip

AI assistance doesn't end once you've booked the trip. The joy (and challenge) of travel is that it's dynamic. Plans change: you decide to sleep in, it starts raining, or the place you wanted to visit is unexpectedly closed.

We expect that AI tools will accompany travelers on their trips, adjusting plans when needed and automatically canceling or booking reservations. AI can even generate full reviews in the user's voice to post publicly, feeding the dataset for other consumers.

## Business Use Cases

Employees traveling for work need to book flights, hotels, rental cars, and restaurants; AI assistants can understand your company's policies and recommend the best options.

Hotels are using AI-powered tools like [HiJiffy](https://www.hijiffy.com/), [Allora](https://www.allora.ai/), and [Aiello](https://aiello.ai/) to communicate with guests and even upsell them on additional services. A hotel that fully runs its back office (or even front desk) with AI might be coming soon.
