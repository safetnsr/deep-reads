# @venturetwins — justine moore

**who:** justine moore, partner at a16z, focused on consumer AI and generative media. often writes with her sister olivia moore ([@omooretweets](https://x.com/omooretweets)), who covers similar territory. twitter: [@venturetwins](https://x.com/venturetwins). email: jmoore@a16z.com.

**note:** the task brief described @venturetwins as "jack smith, known for vibe coding and building startups live." that's wrong. @venturetwins is justine moore, a16z partner. a different "jack smith" exists in the startup/vibe-coding space, but is not @venturetwins. this deep-read covers the actual @venturetwins.

**what she writes:** long-form essays on where consumer AI is headed, with a heavy focus on generative media (image, video, audio), pricing architecture for AI startups, and consumer behavior patterns. she also co-writes the "accelerated" newsletter (accelerated.substack.com) with her sister.

## what's genuinely good

### the video series is a cohesive, well-timed thesis arc

justine has been tracking AI video since before it was interesting. the [2023 breakout year](why-2023-was-ai-videos-breakout-year.md) piece was published when most of these products were discord bots generating 3-second clips. it correctly maps [how use cases will segment between platforms](why-2023-was-ai-videos-breakout-year.md#outstanding-questions) — a prediction borne out by 2025's model specialization. the [no god tier model](there-is-no-god-tier-video-model.md) piece from late 2025 correctly anticipates that video model progress would plateau and that [specialization](there-is-no-god-tier-video-model.md#the-models-are-specializing) — not one-shot capability dominance — would define the next phase. the [agentic video editing](its-time-for-agentic-video-editing.md) piece closes the arc: now that models are good enough, [the editing workflow is the real bottleneck](its-time-for-agentic-video-editing.md#what-agents-will-be-able-to-tackle).

this is how good analyst writing works: you track a space over time, update your model when the facts change, and identify the next inflection point before it's obvious. she's done this with video more consistently than almost anyone.

### the great expansion is her clearest, most original piece

[the great expansion](the-great-expansion.md) identifies something genuine and under-discussed: consumer AI companies can achieve >100% net revenue retention through usage-based pricing + consumer-to-enterprise expansion. this isn't just pattern-matching to "AI is big." it's a specific structural argument about why the economics of consumer software have changed, with specific examples (google ai, krea, grok pricing tiers) and a concrete recommendation ([hire a head of sales in year 1-2](the-great-expansion.md#strategy-3-enterprise-investment-from-day-one), which sounds counterintuitive for consumer).

the specific thesis — that consumer AI companies should think about enterprise from day one because consumers will bring tools into the workplace — is something a lot of founders haven't internalized yet. [the consumer-to-enterprise bridge strategy](the-great-expansion.md#strategy-2-the-consumer-to-enterprise-bridge) gives them a framework. the canva example is apt: a company that waited seven years to launch teams would have been beaten to market in the AI era.

### she's honest about product failures, including ones at labs she respects

the [state of consumer AI 2025](state-of-consumer-ai-2025.md) is unusually candid for an a16z piece. she says flat out that none of openai's "new experiences" (Pulse, Group Chats, Record, etc.) have "truly broken through." she calls out google for making their products inaccessible and [confusing](https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1929771247799619949). she credits anthropic's agent as "much faster and more reliable" than chatgpt's — a meaningful admission given openai's market dominance. this is not the typical VC puff-piece that praises everything. the data in this piece is unusually specific: chatgpt's DAU/MAU of 36% vs. gemini's 21%, month-12 retention of 50% vs. 25%, gemini pro subscriptions growing 300% YoY vs. chatgpt's 155%.

### AI x commerce is underrated

[the commerce piece](ai-x-commerce.md) does something most AI analysis fails at: it disaggregates the market. "AI will transform commerce" is meaningless. but [breaking commerce into five categories](ai-x-commerce.md#defining-commerce-and-its-AI-opportunities) — impulse buys (AI-immune), routine essentials (agentic purchasing), lifestyle purchases (AI research agents), functional purchases (AI consultants), and life purchases (AI coach) — is actually useful. the table breaking down each purchase category across pre-internet / internet / AI eras is the clearest framework she's written.

the google analysis is also sharp: [google doesn't need to retain all searches, just the monetizable ones](ai-x-commerce.md#is-google-screwed-maybe-but-not-how-you-think). losing informational queries to chatgpt doesn't kill google's ad business — losing "best X for Y" queries does. and the section on [what else needs to happen](ai-x-commerce.md#what-else-needs-to-happen) — better data, unified APIs, identity/memory, embedded capture — is a useful map of infrastructure gaps for founders.

### the state of generative media report has real enterprise survey data

the [state of generative media vol. 1](state-of-generative-media.md) is different in character from the other pieces — it's a fal.ai industry report rather than an op-ed. but it covers [enterprise ROI](state-of-generative-media.md#enterprise-roi) with specific numbers: 34% of organizations already profitable, 65% achieving ROI within 12 months. the [industry deployment data](state-of-generative-media.md#industry-deployments) is granular: advertising at 56% adoption, entertainment at 43%, gaming at 68%. the [model orchestration finding](state-of-generative-media.md#model-orchestration-and-management) — "enterprise production deployments use a median of 14 different models" — is one of the most useful single statistics in the corpus.

## what's weak

### some pieces are taxonomy projects dressed as analysis

the [generative AI: the next consumer platform](generative-ai-the-next-consumer-platform.md) piece from 2023 is really a list of categories ([search](generative-ai-the-next-consumer-platform.md#search), [education](generative-ai-the-next-consumer-platform.md#education), [relationships](generative-ai-the-next-consumer-platform.md#relationships), [therapy and coaching](generative-ai-the-next-consumer-platform.md#therapy-and-coaching), [creation](generative-ai-the-next-consumer-platform.md#creation), [games](generative-ai-the-next-consumer-platform.md#games), [tooling for small businesses](generative-ai-the-next-consumer-platform.md#tooling-for-small-businesses)) with one or two example companies per category. there's nothing wrong with this as a framework post — it's a "here's what we're watching" piece for investors, not a thesis. but it doesn't have a real argument. it says "AI will improve all these things" without explaining which will succeed and why. reading the full article confirms this: it's a landscape map, not a prediction. the examples (You, Neeva, Speak, Quazel, Replika, CharacterAI) are interesting historical artifacts — some of these companies succeeded, some didn't — but the piece doesn't explain the selection logic.

same issue with [AI x travel](adventure-is-out-there-ai-x-travel.md). the categories ([inspiration](adventure-is-out-there-ai-x-travel.md#using-ai-for-inspiration), [itinerary planning](adventure-is-out-there-ai-x-travel.md#using-ai-for-itinerary-planning), [booking](adventure-is-out-there-ai-x-travel.md#using-ai-for-booking), [on-trip](adventure-is-out-there-ai-x-travel.md#using-ai-while-on-the-trip), [business use cases](adventure-is-out-there-ai-x-travel.md#business-use-cases)) are logical but not differentiated. every category gets the same treatment: "here's what AI could do here, here are some early examples." there's no prediction about which category wins first or which has the hardest structural problems. the piece correctly identifies the "correctness" issue (hallucinated restaurants) as a challenge, and proposes three partial solutions, but doesn't reason through which solution actually wins. it's a map, not a compass.

### the "vibe code" piece is sharp but stops short

[most people can't vibe code](most-people-cant-vibe-code.md) is her most recent piece (february 2026) and her clearest consumer-first argument. the [four problems framework](most-people-cant-vibe-code.md#the-four-problems) (setup, security, imagination, deployment) is immediately useful. her use of herself as a test case — "my success rate is probably 50/50" and she references [struggling with openclaw](most-people-cant-vibe-code.md#the-non-technical-mindset) — adds credibility. the squarespace/canva analogy for [the opportunity](most-people-cant-vibe-code.md#the-opportunity) is well-chosen. the "imagination problem" is the most original insight — non-technical people don't just lack tools, they lack mental models for what's buildable. but the piece stops at diagnosis. the companies she names (poke, wabi) get one sentence each. a deeper analysis of what "products for people" actually looks like in practice — what UI patterns work, what fails, what the retention curves show — would elevate this from good framework piece to essential reading.

### the ads piece is comprehensive but ideologically convenient

[of course they're putting ads in AI](of-course-theyre-putting-ads-in-ai.md) is co-authored with bryan kim and is substantially longer than it first appeared. it covers seven distinct monetization models: [intent-based search ads](of-course-theyre-putting-ads-in-ai.md#higher-value-search-and-intent-based-advertising), [context-based instagram-style ads](of-course-theyre-putting-ads-in-ai.md#context-based-ads-in-the-style-of-instagram), [affiliate commerce](of-course-theyre-putting-ads-in-ai.md#affiliate-commerce), [games](of-course-theyre-putting-ads-in-ai.md#games), [goal-based bidding](of-course-theyre-putting-ads-in-ai.md#goal-based-bidding), [companion subscriptions](of-course-theyre-putting-ads-in-ai.md#subscriptions-for-ai-entertainment-and-companions), and [token-based pricing](of-course-theyre-putting-ads-in-ai.md#pricing-by-token-usage). the goal-based bidding concept — setting bounties per query to unlock more compute — is the most original idea. the [luxury beliefs](of-course-theyre-putting-ads-in-ai.md#the-luxury-beliefs-problem) framing is sharp rhetoric but also convenient: a16z is an investor in ad-supported platforms, so "ads are why we have nice things" is not a neutral observation. the [scale argument](of-course-theyre-putting-ads-in-ai.md#the-scale-argument) ("5-10% of 800M WAUs is still 40-80M paying users") is the strongest data point. weakest section: the instagram comparison — transposing lean-back discovery ads into an intent-heavy chat interface is acknowledged as hard but never really resolved.

### the data-to-recommendation gap

justine consistently provides good market data (DAU/MAU numbers, retention rates, growth percentages) but the leap from data to investment recommendation is often implicit. the [state of consumer AI 2025](state-of-consumer-ai-2025.md#where-do-startups-fit-in) section "where do startups fit in?" ends with "we've never been more excited about what startups can build." this is a16z's conclusion but it's not really derived from the data in the piece. the data shows chatgpt dominating, gemini accelerating, and grok growing fast — not obviously an argument for startups over labs. a sharper conclusion would require more argument.

## patterns in her thinking

**the specialization thesis keeps recurring.** from [AI video's breakout year](why-2023-was-ai-videos-breakout-year.md#outstanding-questions) to [no god tier model](there-is-no-god-tier-video-model.md#the-models-are-specializing) to the commerce piece — she consistently argues that markets don't produce one winner, they produce many specialists serving different needs. this is a real thesis, not just pattern-matching. it's influenced how she thinks about both the model layer and the product layer.

**she's systematically pro-startup despite being an incumbent platform investor.** every piece ends with a version of "here's the opportunity for founders" and her contact info. this is partly marketing but also reflects a real view: that model companies don't have the attention or intuition to build great consumer products. she's been proven right more often than not on this.

**she tracks the product layer more carefully than the model layer.** the [god tier video model](there-is-no-god-tier-video-model.md) piece explicitly argues that "even if video model progress stopped entirely, founders would be playing years of catch-up building products around current model capabilities." this is a smart framing — it makes her bullish on application-layer startups independent of whether frontier model progress continues or slows.

**she's been ahead on video and commerce, slower on social AI.** her coverage of companion AI / social chatbots is thin relative to the market size (character.ai gets mentioned as a data point but rarely as a thesis). this might be strategic (a16z invested elsewhere) or might just be a gap.

**the consumer-to-enterprise bridge is her sharpest monetization insight.** [the great expansion](the-great-expansion.md#strategy-2-the-consumer-to-enterprise-bridge) is the most original piece in the corpus. it's a prediction about monetization mechanics that requires both consumer behavior data and enterprise sales intuition — a combination that's genuinely uncommon.

## summary judgment

justine moore / @venturetwins is a serious analyst with a coherent worldview. she's at her best when she has a specific thesis to argue (the great expansion, the no god tier model, the commerce categories), and at her worst when she's doing landscape mapping (the 2023 consumer platform piece, the travel piece). her video coverage is probably the most consistently valuable thing she's published — it spans three years, updates based on new evidence, and correctly identified both the opportunity and the bottleneck at each stage.

she's a vc writing to attract founders (every piece ends with "reach out if you're building here"), which creates an obvious incentive to be bullish. but she tempers this with real candor about product failures and genuine attempts to disaggregate rather than generalize. relative to the average a16z essay, this is high quality work.

her sister olivia's co-authored pieces (especially [state of consumer AI 2025](state-of-consumer-ai-2025.md)) are indistinguishable in quality and voice — they clearly have a shared analytical framework.
