# AI x Commerce

## Is Google Screwed? Maybe. But Not How You Think.

The internet's most profitable business model has always been simple: running search ads on monetizable queries. When you search "how many protons are in a cesium atom," Google makes no money. When you search "best tennis racket," it prints cash.

This asymmetry defines the entire search economy — some queries are pure curiosity, others have direct purchase intent. It's part of why Google is a $2T company and Wikipedia is a non-profit.

Google could lose 95% of search volume and still grow revenue — as long as it retains the valuable queries, which are largely commerce related. The big question: has Google managed to keep these searches from moving to AI platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity?

Maybe. Apple SVP Eddy Cue testified during the DOJ's antitrust trial that Safari search volume had declined for the first time in over two decades. Alphabet's stock dropped nearly 8% in a day — all from the hint that queries might be leaking to AI. But Google's increasing revenue (including from search!) makes it clear that Google is likely only losing low-monetizing queries, at least for now.

**AI is eating the low-value queries first** — the ones with no commercial intent. The revenue remains until AI starts replacing "best X for Y" commerce journeys with actual purchase intent. That's about to happen, but not all commerce is the same.

## Defining "Commerce" and its AI Opportunities

We can split purchases into five rough categories, ordered by level of consideration:

| Category | Pre-Internet | Internet | AI |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Impulse buy** | Checkout line items | Deals on Amazon/Groupon | Hyper-optimized TikTok/IG algos |
| **Routine essentials** | Grocery stores/Costco | Delivery apps like Instacart | AI agent tracks prices and buys for you |
| **Lifestyle purchases** | Specialty brand stores | Researching on Reddit/blogs | AI researcher finds + suggests SKUs |
| **Functional purchases** | Talking to experts at Best Buy | Online shopping with some D2C | AI "consultant" meets with you and recommends |
| **Life purchases** | Meet with experts, visit options | Initial research shifts online (Zillow), remains consultative | AI coach helps kickstart research |

## How AI Will Impact Each Category

**1. Impulse buys** — limited opportunity for AI agents (you don't research in advance). However, the algorithms that guide your attention will continue to improve. And it will be easier for brands to create hyper-personalized marketing materials: imagine watching a Reel about Mother's Day gifts and immediately getting an ad for a candle engraved with her name.

**2. Routine essentials** — AI should play a role when it comes to sourcing and purchasing. If you regularly get the same laundry detergent, your AI agent could monitor and buy on your behalf if the price dips below a certain level.

**3. Lifestyle purchases** — imagine deputizing an AI agent to do the grunt work and come back with a recommendation explaining why a specific SKU is perfect for you based on your past purchases, what it knows about your preferences, and even things like your body type. We're starting to see early examples with products like [Plush](https://www.plush.shop/).

**4. Functional purchases** — these items are important because they are (1) a meaningful financial investment, and (2) a product you'll use every day. You'll likely want to have a more in-depth conversation with a subject-matter expert — an AI "consultant" — about different options. We see an opportunity for AI consultants with deep knowledge on a product category across different brands, that learn more context on each user over time.

**5. Life purchases** — it's hard to imagine people fully outsourcing these decisions to AI. But an AI coach will guide you through the process of choosing — from researching the initial set of options to evaluating pros & cons to negotiating terms or reviewing contracts (we already see founders sending us term sheets marked up by Claude).

## Why Amazon (and Shopify) Are Well Situated

Amazon owns search, delivery, reorder data, and reviews. It is an integrated commerce stack. While AI search can effectively disintermediate Amazon, Amazon itself serves as a search engine for commerce with an embedded loyalty program boasting hundreds of millions of subscribers.

Shopify powers the merchant side: hosting SKUs, facilitating checkout, enabling D2C brands. Through Shop Pay and the Shop App, it's now building a consumer-side wedge too.

As agents become the new interface for buying, both platforms are well-positioned — Amazon with end-to-end control, Shopify with distributed ownership across millions of stores.

## What Else Needs to Happen

AI agents can't fulfill their potential in commerce without major shifts in the substrate they operate on:

**1. Better data:** Most product reviews are noisy, gamed, or overly polarized. Agents need access to structured, trustworthy, real-time feedback. Today AI just summarizes the web, and cannot turn shilled junk into honest analysis.

**2. Unified APIs:** To move from recommendations to transactions, agents must be able to interface cleanly across retail platforms — pulling accurate data on products and eventually checking out on the user's behalf.

**3. Identity and memory:** Agents that understand your preferences, past purchases, and deal thresholds can automate routine buying and curate lifestyle decisions. This memory must be dynamic and multi-faceted — preferences change over time.

**4. Embedded capture:** The best AI-native experiences will capture data directly in the user journey that contributes to better recommendations — direct feedback after purchases, or passive signals like how long you linger on a specific item.

Until these foundations are in place, LLMs will remain clever summarizers — not true commercial agents. But this is happening fast — look for the "middle three" areas of commerce (lifestyle, functional, life purchases) to start being eaten by AI quickly.
