# State of Consumer AI 2025: Product Hits, Misses, and What's Next

It was a big year for consumer launches from the major AI labs. OpenAI shipped dozens of AI features. Gemini released several insanely viral image and video generation models. Other labs like Anthropic, Perplexity, xAI, and Meta all released new consumer-facing tools across chat, coding, search, image generation, and more. The result? Somewhat of a mixed bag.

Overall, AI usage is up. But when it comes to a general assistant, the vast majority of consumers are still using only one. For most of the year, fewer than 10% of ChatGPT weekly users even visited another one of the big model providers. And data from Yipit suggests that spend is equally concentrated — only 9% of consumers pay for more than one subscription across ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Cursor. While the LLM assistant race may not be "winner take all," it's looking like it might be "winner take most."

ChatGPT has sustained massive consumer adoption with an estimated 800–900M WAUs across platforms. Gemini is at 34% of ChatGPT's scale on web, and 40% on mobile. Per Yipit, ChatGPT's DAU/MAU of 36% is nearly double Gemini's 21%. Month 12 desktop user retention of 50% is similarly double Gemini's 25%.

## OpenAI

ChatGPT came into the year as by far the dominant player. They had the first big viral launch of the year with 4o-image generation in March (the mass Ghibli event), adding 1M users per hour at the peak.

OpenAI's consumer strategy was pushing new models and experiences through the existing ChatGPT interface. New experiences include: Pulse (daily updates), Group Chats, Record (transcriber), Shopping Research, Tasks, and Study Mode. **None of the new experiences have truly "broken through" in terms of either usage or retention.** It's hard to deliver a first class product experience within the constraints of the existing ChatGPT interface.

Two big exceptions:

1. **Sora** — got a standalone app this year. More than 12M global downloads as a creative tool. Less successful as a social app, with SensorTower estimating retention sub-8% at day 30. (D30 retention is above 30% for top consumer apps.)

2. **Atlas** (the company's browser) — a powerful and well-executed product, still available only on Mac. Yipit estimates under 5% of ChatGPT users have visited the Atlas download page.

Next year, we're looking towards where they take Apps — their new infrastructure for allowing third party developers to build experiences in ChatGPT. ChatGPT has a chance to become the first true new consumer platform in more than a decade if this is successful.

## Google

Google has come a long way since the days of Bard. Unlike OpenAI, Google creates more surface area for new products — launching models within Gemini and other access points, but also creating standalone experiences.

**Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro** won the consumer zeitgeist. In the first week, Nano Banana saw 200M images generated and brought in 10M new users in Gemini.

**Veo 3** was arguably the breakthrough moment for AI video in combining visual and audio generation.

**NotebookLM** may be the best example of Google launching successful new interfaces. Initially went viral in September 2024 — web users more than doubled YoY as of November. Mobile app has 8M MAUs.

Google has released many other products with relatively muted traction — Portraits, Doppl, Whisk, Gems. The most significant area for improvement: **access is confusing**. It's [hard to figure out](https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1929771247799619949) where to access new products, and what kind of account you need.

## Other Players

### Anthropic

Anthropic remains focused on the "prosumer" user — specifically technical users. Almost all consumer-facing launches were within Claude or extending Claude.

Their most powerful launches: **Skills and Artifacts** — geared towards sophisticated users. Anthropic was the first big lab to launch a dedicated effort towards generating slides, documents, and models — and [in testing](https://x.com/omooretweets/status/1965452227033899276), their product is much faster and more reliable than ChatGPT's Agent.

Claude finally caught up on: Voice Mode, Memory, Web Search, and Research. This feels more like re-establishing "table stakes" than trying to attract a new audience.

Next year: expect continued investment in Claude Code, which [reached](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone) a $1B run rate in six months.

### Perplexity

Doubled down on the prosumer user, focus on the "productivity hacker." Biggest launches: **Comet** (arguably the first true AI browser, more than a million users) and **Email Assistant**.

$100M run rate in March this year, with 6x YoY growth in paid usage, and [more than 20M](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/ceo-says-perplexity-hit-780m-q-dENgiYOuTfaMEpxLQc2bIQ) monthly active users.

### xAI

Grok went from zero users at the beginning of the year to 9.5M DAU and 38M MAU as of mid-December. In July, xAI made waves with **Companions** (Ani and Rudi) — the first AI companions with fully animated characters and more controversial personalities.

### Meta

A rockier year. Meta AI app [went viral](https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1932934055378759805) in June when people discovered older users were accidentally sharing conversations with the chatbot on the main Discover feed. Re-launched in September with "Vibes," a scrolling feed of short form AI-generated videos.

## Where do startups fit in?

Despite all this activity from the model giants, **we've never been more excited about what startups can build in consumer AI.**

Model companies are focused on: (1) models themselves, and (2) new features largely delivered via existing products. This leaves huge white space for founders building dedicated consumer experiences.

Consumer AI products that have "broken out" include: Replit, Gamma, Character AI, Suno, Eleven Labs, Manus, Krea, Lovable. These products have opinionated and focused interfaces that give consumers superpowers beyond what the model companies offer themselves.

These products have also [grown revenue faster](https://x.com/omooretweets/status/1931750864622121338) than ever before.
