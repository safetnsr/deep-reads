# The Great Expansion: A New Era of Consumer Software

AI has ushered in a wave of new consumer products that are growing faster than ever before. Companies are going from zero to millions of users and surpassing $100M ARR in less than two years — a growth trajectory unheard of before AI.

What explains this? Distribution is faster, and ARPU is higher. But the biggest shift has gone largely unmentioned: **AI has transformed revenue retention patterns for consumer software.**

## The Old Model: Built for Churn

Before AI, consumer software companies made money in two primary ways:

**Advertising-based revenue** — primarily for social apps, directly tied to usage and therefore usually flat per user over time. Examples: Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat.

**One-tier subscriptions** — where all premium users pay the same flat fee per month or year. Examples: Duolingo, Calm, YouTube Premium.

Under both models, revenue retention — the percentage of revenue a cohort retains year-over-year — was almost always below 100%. For consumer subscription products, cohorts with 30-40% user and revenue retention at the end of year 1 were considered "best in class."

This created a fundamental constraint: companies had to constantly replace churned revenue just to maintain growth, let alone expand.

## The AI Era: Enter the Great Expansion

The fastest growing consumer AI companies are now seeing revenue retention above 100%. This happens in two ways: (1) consumers spending more as usage-based revenue replaces flat "access" fees, and (2) consumers bringing tools into their workplaces, where they can be expensed and supported with larger budgets.

At 50% revenue retention, a company must replace half its base every year just to stay even. At more than 100%, every cohort is expanding — growth compounding on top of growth.

## Strategy 1: Sophisticated Pricing Architecture

### Price Segmentation + Usage-Based Billing

The most successful consumer AI companies use hybrid models with multiple subscription tiers plus usage-based components. There are lessons here from gaming, where companies have long generated the majority of revenue from high-spend "whales."

**Google AI:** $20/month Pro subscription and $249/month Ultra subscription with additional charges for Veo3 credits when users exceed their included amount. Extra credit packages start at $25 and scale to $200.

**Krea:** plans ranging from $10-$60/month based on anticipated usage, with the ability to purchase additional credits in packs between $5 – $40 (valid for 90 days).

**Grok:** SuperGrok at $30/month with SuperGrok Heavy at $300/month, unlocking new models, extended access, longer memory, and new feature testing.

These models let revenue grow in step with user engagement — and some consumer companies are seeing >100% revenue retention on this alone.

## Strategy 2: The Consumer-to-Enterprise Bridge

### Basic Team Functionality Creates Massive ARPU Expansion

Consumers are actively rewarded for bringing AI tools into their workplaces. Any product with potential work applications should assume that users will want to bring it into their teams — and they will pay significantly more when they can expense it.

The transition from price-sensitive consumers to price-insensitive enterprise buyers creates major expansion opportunities. But it requires: team folders, shared libraries, collaborative canvases, authentication, and security.

**ChatGPT:** individual subscriptions cost $20/month, while enterprise plans range from $25 to $60 per user.

**Gamma:** Plus plan ($8/month) to remove watermarks — a requirement for most corporate use. Users then pay for each collaborator added to their workspace.

**Replit:** $20/month for Core users. Team plan starts at $35/month with additional credits, centralized billing, role-based access control, private deployments.

**Cursor:** $20/month for Pro plan; $200/month for Ultra. Teams pay $40/month for org-wide privacy mode, a usage and admin dashboard, centralized billing, and SAML/SSO.

## Strategy 3: Enterprise Investment from Day One

### Build Sales Capabilities Early

Consumer companies should now think about hiring a Head of Sales within their first one to two years. Grassroots adoption can only take a product so far; securing broad organizational use requires navigating enterprise procurement.

Canva, founded in 2013, waited nearly seven years before launching its Teams product. **In 2025, that kind of delay is no longer viable.**

Key features that often determine outcomes:
- **Security/Privacy:** SOC-2 compliance, SSO/SAML support
- **Operations/Billing:** Role-based access control, centralized billing
- **Product:** Team templates, shared themes, collaborative workflows

ElevenLabs is a good example: began with heavy consumer usage but moved quickly to build enterprise-grade capabilities, adding HIPAA compliance to position itself for healthcare and regulated markets.

## The Bottom Line

This shift allows consumer companies to scale in ways that were once impossible — and to become big businesses in months, not decades. [Our data shows](https://a16z.com/revenue-benchmarks-ai-apps/) that consumer businesses are outpacing B2B in early revenue growth.

We think many of the most important enterprise companies of the AI era will likely begin as consumer products. The founders who embrace sophisticated pricing, design bridges from consumer to enterprise, and invest early in enterprise capabilities will be best positioned to build the next generation of hyperscalers.
